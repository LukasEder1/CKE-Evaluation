Proofpoint understands the importance of safeguarding your privacy and we take this responsibility very seriously. We are providing the following Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures for the collection, use and disclosure of any information about you that we collect via proofpoint.com (this “Site”) or by other means. 

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason and each version will apply to information collected while such version was in place unless you consent to (including by not opting out of) our application of a new version to information we had previously collected . We will notify you of any material changes to our Privacy Policy by posting the new policy on the Site. We suggest that you consult the Site regularly to check for any changes to this Privacy Policy. 

In this policy, “using” and “processing” information includes using cookies on a computer, subjecting the information to statistical or other analysis and using or handling information in any way, including without limitation collecting, storing, evaluating, modifying, deleting, using, combining, disclosing and transferring information within our organization or among our affiliates within the United States or internationally. 

## Information We Collect and Use

Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our products and services, to provide quality customer service, to contact companies whose representative has indicated an interest in receiving information about Proofpoint products and to enable users to effectively navigate the Site. 

We may collect your contact information in the following ways: if you sign up for offers on the Site, provide your contact information to us at a trade show, web seminar or similar event, download white papers from the Site, respond to a promotion offered by a Proofpoint partner or send us an email. Such contact information includes first and last name, title, company name, industry type, mailing address, telephone number, fax number, email address and company size (“Contact Information”). We may also collect information about your mailbox size, which will allow us to classify your company by size. We may combine your Contact Information with information collected from others in order to improve the quality and value of our products and services, and to analyze and understand how our Site is used. 

We also use your Contact Information to contact you with certain marketing or promotional materials, as well as other information that may be of interest to you. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications.

## Log Data

When you visit the Site, we automatically collect technical and statistical data about your visit, such as your browser type, the pages you visit and any search terms you use (“Log Data”). We also collect your public IP address when you visit the Site. We may use your public IP address in order to determine whether certain requests are fraudulent or frivolous and we may automatically cross-reference your public IP address with your domain name (usually the domain name of your ISP or employer). Because you may be visiting the Site from your personal residence (for example, because you are telecommuting), your IP address and any associated domain name are treated as “Personal Network Information” instead of Contact Information. “Log Data” does not include Personal Network Information. Although such Personal Network Information may be used to administer and maintain the Site, it is not shared with any third parties, except as described below in the sections titled “Service Providers,” “Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement” and “Business Transfers.” We will use Log Data for any purpose.

## Aggregated Information

In addition, we may cull certain data from within the set of Contact Information, Personal Network Information and Log Data we collect from you and combine that information with information we collect from other Proofpoint users and customers (collectively the “Aggregated Information”) in order to improve the quality and value of Proofpoint product offerings and to analyze and understand how our Site is used. 

## Cookies

Like many websites, we use “cookies” to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard disk for record keeping purposes. We use cookies for two purposes. First, we utilize persistent cookies to save your registration ID and login password for future logins to the Site. Second, we utilize session ID cookies to enable certain features of the Site, to better understand how you interact with the Site, and to monitor aggregate usage by Proofpoint users and web traffic routing on the Site. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted from your computer when you close your browser. You can instruct your browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Site or all functionality of the service.

## Information Sharing and Disclosure 

From time to time we may share your Contact Information with our authorized channel partners so that they can provide you with information on goods or services that may be of interest to you. You can, at any time, opt out of receiving such communications. 

We may share Aggregated Information (after stripping of any information that would personally identify you) and Log Data with third parties for industry analysis, demographic profiling, and other purposes. 

| 

## Service Providers

We use the services of Salesforce.com and other third party companies and individuals to perform Site-related services (for example, without limitation, website hosting, maintenance services, database management, Web analytics, and improvement of the Site’s features). These third parties have access to your Contact Information, Personal Network Information, and Log Data only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose. For the specific privacy practices of Salesforce.com, refer to the Salesforce.com privacy policy. 

## Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement

Proofpoint cooperates with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We will disclose your Contact Information, Personal Network Information, and Log Data to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including without limitation subpoenas and notice of class certification), to protect the property and rights of Proofpoint or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop any illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity. 

## Business Transfers

Proofpoint may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets, including your Contact Information, Personal Network Information, and Log Data, in connection with a merger, reorganization, or sale of assets, or in the event of bankruptcy.

## Changing or Deleting Your Information

You may review, update, correct or delete your Contact Information or Personal Network Information by contacting us. See below for privacy contact information. 

## Security & International Transfer 

Proofpoint is very concerned with safeguarding your information. We employ administrative, physical, procedural, and technological measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access. Your information may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to us, Proofpoint transfers your Contact and Personal Network Information to the United States and processes it there. Your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer. For the security and international transfer policies of Salesforce.com, refer to the Salesforce.com privacy policy. 

## Links to Other Sites

Our Site contains links to other websites. If you click on a third-party link you will be directed to that third party’s website. We do not exercise control over third-party websites. These other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. This Privacy Policy addresses the use and disclosure of information that we collect from you through this Site. Other sites follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites you visit. The fact that we link to a website is not an endorsement, authorization, or representation of our affiliation with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices. 

## Our Policy Toward Children

This Site is not directed to children under 18. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with personal or contact information without their consent, he or she should contact us at Privacy@Proofpoint.com.

### Organizational and Personal Information You Knowingly Give Us.

Within our web sites, you may be asked to give us personal or organizational information in order to purchase or receive information about a product or service. We may collect this information through different methods, including:

  * Registration Forms. We encourage all visitors to register with Progress Software, although registration is not required, except for access to our premium content areas. The registration forms require users to give us accurate contact information (like name and email address) and references that help us better serve you. Your name and email address may be used to send you information about our company, product updates, special offers, and newsletters.

The information that we require in our order form is only used to process your order quickly and accurately. Your contact information will only be used to send you the product that you purchase and your billing information will only be used to bill you for that product. During the purchasing process, you may be given the opportunity to sign up for future e-mailings regarding our products, services, and promotions. If you sign up, we will share your contact information with other Progress Software partner companies only, not with other outside companies.



You may also be given the option of registering a profile with us which would store your name, purchase history, and billing information to make it easier for you to shop and purchase products/services from us in the future.

Progress Software may collect other information, including, but not necessarily limited to:

  * Contact information, such as name, physical address, telephone number(s), email address, and company.

Organizational and Personal Information You Knowingly Give Us.

Within our Progress Software Websites, you may be asked to give us personal or organizational information in order to purchase or receive information about a product or service. We may collect this information through different methods, including:

  * Registration Forms. We encourage all visitors to register with Progress Software, although registration is not required, except for access to our premium content areas. The registration forms require users to give us accurate contact information (like name and email address) and references that help us better serve you. Your name and email address may be used to send you information about our company, product updates, special offers, and newsletters. To opt out of receiving communications from Progress Software, please Contact Us. 
  * Order Forms and Enrollment Forms. Our order forms securely collect visitor’s contact information and financial information (like your credit card number and other billing information). Contact information on the order form is used for order fulfillment and may be shared with our Partners or Resellers if that is necessary to fulfill your request. The information that we require in our order form is only used to process your order quickly and accurately. Your contact information will only be used to send you the product that you purchase and your billing information will only be used to bill you for that product. During the purchasing process, you may be given the opportunity to sign up for future e-mailings regarding our products, services, and promotions. If you sign up, we will share your contact information with other Progress Software partner companies only, not with other outside companies.



You may also be given the option of registering a profile with us which would store your name, purchase history, and billing information to make it easier for you to shop and purchase products/services from us in the future. You may opt out of this feature at any time by changing/canceling your profile online.

Progress Software may collect other information, including, but not necessarily limited to:

  * Contact information, such as name, physical address, telephone number(s), email address, and company. The majority of the information collected under this category is business contact information and when this information is collected in forms on our Progress Software Websites, it is collected and/or transmitted using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology. 
  * Transactional information, including information about the products and services you purchase or download or about which you make an inquiry. 
  * User preferences, such as product requirements, areas of industry interest, newsletters, community choices and other information you select in the customer profile when registering on Progress Software Websites or indicated by your use of the Progress Software Websites. 
  * Financial/credit card and payment information. Please see the “How Progress Software Uses and Shares This Information” section for more information.
  * Event and conference participation information, such as lectures, classes or booths attended or visited during an event or conference hosted or attended by Progress Software. If we use electronic tracking technologies at an event, we will provide notice in the event registration materials and/or correspondence.
  * Other information which may include, but is not limited to, browser and device information, data collected through automated electronic interactions, application usage data, demographic information, geographic or geo-location information, statistical and aggregated information. Statistical or aggregated information does not directly identify a specific person, but it may be derived from personal information. For example, we may aggregate personal information to calculate the percentage of users in a particular zip code.



We may also supplement information you provide with information received from third parties.

Information Gathered through Electronic Protocols.

Statistics and Information Collected as You Browse Progress Software Websites

As you browse our Progress Software Websites, Progress Software’s Web servers collect information about your visit, not about you personally. Via Web server logs, we monitor statistics such as:

  * How many people visit our Progress Software Websites. 
  * Which pages people visit on our Progress Software Websites. 
  * From which domains our visitors come (e.g., “yahoo.com” or “aol.com”).
  * Which browsers people use to visit our Progress Software Websites.



While we gather this type of information, none of it is associated with you as an individual. We use these statistics to improve our Progress Software Websites, to monitor their performance, and to make it easier for you and other visitors to use the sites.

Our Progress Software Websites also log Host Names (or IP addresses when the Host Name is not available) for systems administration and security purposes. These logs are monitored and analyzed to maintain systems and information security and allow us to constantly improve the value and the availability of the Web content.

Cookies

A cookie is a small, encrypted data string our server writes to your hard drive that contains your unique User ID. Cookies on the Progress Software Websites may collect a unique identifier, user preferences and profile information and membership information. Progress Software’s server will query your browser to see if there are “cookies” previously set by the Progress Software Websites.

We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies to deliver Web content specific to your interests and to control access to restricted content. Session ID cookies expire when you close your browser. Persistent cookies remain on your hard drive after you leave our Progress Software Websites. The majority are set to expire within 90 – 365 days. We also use cookies to collect general usage and volume statistical information that does not include personally identifiable information. 

A cookie cannot be used to access or otherwise compromise the data on your hard drive. While we do not offer an opt-out for cookies, browsers provide you information and control over cookies. You can set your browser to alert you when a cookie is being used, and accept or reject the cookie. You can also set your browser to refuse all cookies or accept only cookies returned to the originating servers. You can generally disable the cookie feature on your browser without affecting your ability to use the site, except in some cases where cookies are used as an essential security feature necessary for transaction completion and might be required to complete certain functions on our Progress Software Websites.

Flash Cookies

We may use flash cookies, also known as “local shared objects”, on our Progress Software Websites that employ Flash technology. Flash cookies are small files similar to browser cookies and are used to remember the site’s settings to personalize the look and feel of the site. Like normal cookies, Flash cookies are represented as small files on your computer.

Embedded URLs

We also use a tracking technique that employs embedded URLs to allow use of the site without cookies. Embedded URLs allow limited information to follow you as you navigate the site, but is not associated with personal information and is not used beyond the session.

Embedded Pixels

On our Progress Software Websites, we may use embedded pixel technologies on selected pages for the purposes of identifying unique user visits to the Progress Software Websites as opposed to aggregate hits. In addition, embedded pixels or other technologies may be used in emails to provide information on when the email was opened to track marketing campaign responsiveness; information collected using these technologies may be associated with the recipient’s email address.

Third Party Cookies

Progress Software has engaged one or more third party service providers to track and analyze usage and volume statistical information from visitors to the Progress Software Websites, as well as to optimize and serve ads based on your past visits to our Progress Software Websites. The service provider(s) set cookies on behalf of Progress Software. One such service provider is Google Analytics. We use Display Advertising and Remarketing with Google Analytics. As a result of these cookies, third party vendors, including Google, will show our ads on sites across the Internet. You may opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising or customize Google Display Network ads by using the Ads Preferences Manager on Google’s website.

Widgets

Our Progress Software Websites include Widgets, which are interactive mini-programs that run on our site to provide specific services from another company (e.g., links to bookmarked sites). Some information, such as your email address, may be collected through the Widget. Cookies may also be set by the Widget to enable it to function properly. Information collected by this Widget is governed by the privacy policy of the company that created it.

Personally identifiable information that is needed in order to issue an invoice is stored on Progress Software Web servers in a commercially reasonable manner designed to safeguard against unauthorized access. We have put in place the appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. We do not store unnecessary information about you or for an unnecessary length of time. We may need to share some of this information with delivery services, credit card clearing houses and other third parties to complete the transaction. If we use an automated process to collect your credit card information, we may share this information with a third party vendor specifically selected for its superior practice, in which case we do not retain a copy of that information on our servers.
  * To provide support or other services. We may use your personal information to provide you support or other services you have ordered, as well as product updates, product patches and fixes and other similar communications. 
  * To tailor marketing to your needs and respond to your requests. We may use your personal information to notify you about new product releases and service developments, to respond directly to your requests for information, or pass your contact information to the appropriate Progress Software distributor or reseller for further follow-up related to your interests. 
  * To provide online forums and social networks. Some services available on the Progress Software Websites permit you to participate in interactive discussions, post comments, opportunities or other content to a bulletin board or exchange, or otherwise engage in networking activities. Some of these services are moderated; all may be accessed for technical reasons. Progress Software does not control the content that users post to these forums or social networks. Content posted in these public areas, including advice and opinions, represent the views and is the responsibility of those who post the content.

We may contact you if you download products to confirm certain information about your order (for example, that you did not experience problems in the download process), discuss the downloaded products or provide marketing or sales information about related products and services. We also may use this information to confirm compliance with licensing and other terms of use and may share it with your company. 
  * To communicate with you about a conference or event. We or our partners may communicate with you about a conference or event hosted or co-sponsored by Progress Software or one of our partners. This may include information about the event’s content, event logistics, payment, updates, and any additional meetings, special demonstrations or other customer facilitation that we may provide related to an event for which you have registered. We may contact you after the event about the event and related products and services and may share information about your attendance with your company.

Information Security

The security of your personal information is very important to Progress Software. We have in place physical, administrative and technical safeguards designed to protect your personal information from unauthorized access. In addition, Progress Software uses standard security protocols and mechanisms to exchange the transmission of sensitive data such as credit card details.

In the event that your personal information is acquired, or is reasonably believed to have been acquired, by an unauthorized person and applicable law requires notification, we will notify you of the breach by email, fax, or U.S. mail. We will give you notice promptly, consistent with the reasonable needs of law enforcement and/or Progress Software to determine the scope of the breach and to investigate and restore the integrity of the data system.

Service Providers

We use third parties to assist you if you have questions while using our sites, teleconference services to provide you with webinars and demos, and a service provider to host and provide our content. When you sign up to receive any of these services, we will share your personal information only as necessary with the third party solely for the purpose of providing that service. In addition, we may use a specialized third party for our subscription billing platform.

We provide the information to our trusted distribution partners who work on behalf of or with Progress Software under confidentiality agreements. These companies may use your information to help Progress Software communicate with you about offers from Progress Software and our partners. These companies do not have any independent right to share this information. If you would like to opt out of having your information shared with these third parties you may Contact Us, but please note that opting out may preclude you from licensing certain products due to our point of sale processes.

## Our Use of Your Information

In general, you can browse a large portion of the site without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. Once you give us your personal information, you are not anonymous to us. If you choose to use our services, we may require you to provide contact and identity information, billing information, and other personal information as indicated on the forms throughout the site. You always have the option not to provide information by choosing not to use a particular service or feature. 

We provide you the opportunity to opt-out of having your personal information used for certain purposes when we ask for this information. For example, if you register for a user account but do not wish to receive any additional marketing material from us you can indicate your preference on the registration form. If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter or communication or by emailing us at contact@sedo.com. In addition, we offer an opportunity to opt-out of receiving our newsletter on your account data page, or you may call us at (617) 499-7280. 

You will be notified when your personal information is collected by any third party that is not our agent/service provider so that you can make an informed choice as to whether or not to share your information with that party. 

Under some circumstances we may require some additional financial information, including, without limitation, your billing address, bank account information, a credit card number and expiration date, and tracking information from checks or money orders. 

We may automatically collect certain information based upon your behavior on the site. We use this information to do internal research on our users' demographics, interests, and behavior to serve our users better. This information may include the URL that you come from or go to (whether this URL is on the site or not), your computer browser information, and your IP address. 

We use data collection devices such as ""cookies"" on certain pages of the site to help analyze our web page flow, measure promotional effectiveness, and promote trust and safety. ""Cookies"" are small files placed on your hard drive that assist us in providing our services. We may offer certain features that are only available through the use of a ""cookie."" We also use cookies to allow you to enter your password less frequently during a session. Cookies can also help us provide information targeted to your interests. Personal information you have submitted while on our site is linked with information gathered from our use of cookies in the form of log files. 

This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.  We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information.

Most cookies are ""session cookies,"" meaning that they are automatically deleted from your hard drive at the end of a session. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although in that case you may not be able to use certain features on the site and you may be required to re-enter your password or provide other information more frequently during a session. 

Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers) may use ""cookies"" on our site. We have no access to or control over these ""cookies."" This privacy policy covers the use of ""cookies"" by Sedo only and does not cover the use of ""cookies"" by any advertisers. 

We and or our third party advertising company employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. The main difference between the two is that clear gifs are invisible on the page and are much smaller, about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. Clear gifs are not tied to users’ personal information.

In addition, we use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by the recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If users would like to opt-out of these emails, please email us at contact@sedo.com.

We use local shared objects, also known as Flash cookies to display content based upon what you view on our site to personalize your visit.  Third Parties, with whom we partner to provide certain features on our site or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity, use Flash cookies to collect and store information.

Flash cookies are different from browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored.  Cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies.  To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies click here:

We use Google AdSense to publish ads on this site.  When you view or click on an ad a cookie will be set to help better provide advertisements that may be of interest to you on this and other Web sites.   You may opt-out of the use of this cookie by visiting Google’s Advertising and Privacy page: www.google.com/privacy_ads.html

If you choose to make bids, buy or sell through the site, we may collect information about your bidding, buying and selling behavior and transactions. If you send us personal correspondence, such as emails or letters, or if other users or third parties send us correspondence about your activities on the site, we may collect such information into a file specific to you. 

We use your information and other information we obtain from your current and past activities on the site to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, collect fees owed, pay amounts due you, verify your account data, measure user interest in Sedo's products and services, inform you about online and offline offers, products, services, and updates, customize your experience, detect and protect us against error, fraud and other criminal activity, and enforce our User Agreement. At times, we may look across multiple users to identify problems or resolve disputes, and we may examine your information to identify users using multiple Login Names. 

We may compare and review your information for errors, omissions and for accuracy. You agree that we may use your information to contact you and deliver information to you that, in some cases, is targeted to your perceived interests, such as targeted banner advertisements, administrative notices, product offerings, and communications relevant to your use of the site. By accepting this Agreement, you expressly agree to receive this information. 

## Our Disclosure of Your Information

We do not share, sell or rent any of your personal information to third parties without your explicit consent or in any way other than as outlined in this privacy policy. However, the following describes some of the ways that your personal information may be disclosed in the normal course of business as part of our services. 

Advertisers. We aggregate (gather up data across numerous registered user accounts) personal information and disclose such information in a non-personal manner to advertisers and other third parties for their marketing and promotional purposes.  For such purposes, we do not disclose any information that could be used to identify Sedo users personally. 

We partner with a third party ad network to either display advertising on our Web site or to manage our advertising on other sites.  Our ad network partner uses cookies and Web beacons to collect non-personal information about your activities on this and other Web sites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests.  If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by clicking here.  Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising.  You will continue to receive generic ads.

Site. Although our pages may be coded with robot exclusion headers, others may illegally attempt to automatically collect your email address from the site. If you are involved in a transaction, we have features that may allow other users to view your email address and obtain your contact and other information to help complete the transaction. Further, we may send out notices to you or other users regarding suspicious activity or policy violations on the site. 

Affiliates for Our Operations. We may use third parties (""affiliates"") to facilitate or outsource one or more aspects of the services that we provide to you (e.g., domain name search technology, advertising provisions for parked domains, and other services) and therefore we may provide some of your information directly to these affiliates. These affiliates are subject to confidentiality agreements with us and other legal restrictions that prohibit their use of the information we provide them for any other purpose except to facilitate the specific outsourced service, unless you have explicitly agreed or given your prior permission to them for additional uses. In some instances, the affiliate may collect information directly from you. In these cases, you will be notified of the involvement of the affiliate, and all additional information you provide them and their additional uses will be up to you. It may be necessary to disclose your stored information, such as first and last name, company name, address, email and/or phone number, to relevant domain monetization advertising partners for the purpose of providing you such services.   
  
Agents and Business Entities. We share much of our data, including personal information about you, with our affiliates, subsidiaries, and joint ventures that are committed to serving your online needs and providing related services throughout the world. We use an outside credit card processing company to bill you for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store, or use personal information for any other purposes. To the extent that these entities have access to your information, they will treat it at least as protectively as they treat information they obtain from their other users. Our affiliates, subsidiaries, and joint ventures follow privacy practices no less protective of all users than our practices described in this document, to the extent allowed by applicable law. 

Sedo, its affiliates, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or any combination of such, will share some or all of your information with another business entity should we plan to merge with, or be acquired by, that business entity. Should such a combination occur, we will require that the new combined entity follow this privacy policy with respect to your information.  You will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.

Legal Requests. Sedo cooperates with law enforcement authorities, as well as with other third parties, to enforce laws, intellectual property rights, and to prevent fraud. In response to a verified request by law enforcement or other government officials relating to a criminal investigation or alleged illegal activity, we can, and you authorize us to, disclose your name, city, state, telephone number, email address, login name history, fraud complaints, and site use history, with or without a subpoena. Without limiting the above, we will not disclose your personal information to law enforcement or other government officials without a subpoena, court order or substantially similar legal procedure, except when we believe in good faith that the disclosure of information is necessary to protect our rights or to prevent imminent physical harm, financial loss or to report suspected past, present, or future illegal activity. Further, we can, and you authorize us to, disclose to a third party your information, including your name, street address, city, state, zip code, country, phone number, email, and company name, as we in our sole discretion believe necessary or appropriate in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringement, piracy, or other unlawful activity.

## Our Disclosure of Your Information

We do not share, sell or rent any of your personal information to third parties without your explicit consent or in any way other than as outlined in this privacy policy. However, the following describes some of the ways that your personal information may be disclosed in the normal course of business as part of our services. 

Advertisers. We aggregate (gather up data across numerous registered user accounts) personal information and disclose such information in a non-personal manner to advertisers and other third parties for their marketing and promotional purposes.  For such purposes, we do not disclose any information that could be used to identify Sedo users personally. 

We partner with a third party ad network to either display advertising on our Web site or to manage our advertising on other sites.  Our ad network partner uses cookies and Web beacons to collect non-personal information about your activities on this and other Web sites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by clicking here (or if located in the European Union, click here). Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads.

Site. Although our pages may be coded with robot exclusion headers, others may illegally attempt to automatically collect your email address from the site. If you are involved in a transaction, we have features that may allow other users to view your email address and obtain your contact and other information to help complete the transaction. Further, we may send out notices to you or other users regarding suspicious activity or policy violations on the site. 

Affiliates for Our Operations. We may use third parties (""affiliates"") to facilitate or outsource one or more aspects of the services that we provide to you (e.g., domain name search technology, advertising provisions for parked domains, and other services) and therefore we may provide some of your information directly to these affiliates. These affiliates are subject to confidentiality agreements with us and other legal restrictions that prohibit their use of the information we provide them for any other purpose except to facilitate the specific outsourced service, unless you have explicitly agreed or given your prior permission to them for additional uses. In some instances, the affiliate may collect information directly from you. In these cases, you will be notified of the involvement of the affiliate, and all additional information you provide them and their additional uses will be up to you. It may be necessary to disclose your stored information, such as first and last name, company name, address, email and/or phone number, to relevant domain monetization advertising partners for the purpose of providing you such services.   
  
Agents and Business Entities. We share much of our data, including personal information about you, with our affiliates, subsidiaries, and joint ventures that are committed to serving your online needs and providing related services throughout the world. We use an outside credit card processing company to bill you for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store, or use personal information for any other purposes. To the extent that these entities have access to your information, they will treat it at least as protectively as they treat information they obtain from their other users. Our affiliates, subsidiaries, and joint ventures follow privacy practices no less protective of all users than our practices described in this document, to the extent allowed by applicable law. 

Sedo, its affiliates, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or any combination of such, will share some or all of your information with another business entity should we plan to merge with, or be acquired by, that business entity. Should such a combination occur, we will require that the new combined entity follow this privacy policy with respect to your information.  You will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.

Legal Requests. Sedo cooperates with law enforcement authorities, as well as with other third parties, to enforce laws, intellectual property rights, and to prevent fraud. In response to a verified request by law enforcement or other government officials relating to a criminal investigation or alleged illegal activity, we can, and you authorize us to, disclose your name, city, state, telephone number, email address, login name history, fraud complaints, and site use history, with or without a subpoena. Without limiting the above, we will not disclose your personal information to law enforcement or other government officials without a subpoena, court order or substantially similar legal procedure, except when we believe in good faith that the disclosure of information is necessary to protect our rights or to prevent imminent physical harm, financial loss or to report suspected past, present, or future illegal activity. Further, we can, and you authorize us to, disclose to a third party your information, including your name, street address, city, state, zip code, country, phone number, email, and company name, as we in our sole discretion believe necessary or appropriate in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringement, piracy, or other unlawful activity.

## Use of Other Users' Information

In order to facilitate interaction among site users, our site may allow you limited access to other users' information. By entering into our User Agreement, you agree that, with respect to other users' personal information that you obtain through the site or through a communication or transaction facilitated by Sedo.  Sedo hereby grants to you a limited, non-transferable, revocable license to use such information only for: (a) Sedo-related communications that are not unsolicited commercial messages, (b) using services offered through Sedo (e.g., escrow services and fraud complaints), and (c) any other purpose that a user expressly agrees to after you tell them the purpose you would like to use it for. 

In all cases, you must give users an opportunity to remove themselves from your database and a chance to review what information you have collected about them. In addition, under no circumstances, except as defined herein, can you disclose personal information about another site user to any third party without the written consent of Sedo and the written consent of that user, including, but not limited to, email correspondence with Sedo staff regarding Sedo users, whether in the course of providing Sedo services or otherwise. You agree that other users may use your personal information to communicate with you in accordance with this paragraph. 

## Control of Your Login Name and Password

You are responsible for all actions taken with your login name and password, including fees charged to your account and adherence to the Acceptable Use terms contained in the Sedo User Agreement. Your Sedo user password should be held in strict confidence and under no circumstances will Sedo personnel, its agents or affiliates ask you for your Sedo user password. If you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control over your information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf. Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately change your password as detailed in the paragraph below.

We at Kaspersky Lab will solely use such data for the purpose of scanning and analyzing it for possible malware infection, but we cannot take responsibility regarding your right to share them with us in the first place.

If you do not agree to the results of scanning and would like to receive feedback regarding the possible malware infection of information you have provided to us, you can enter your email address after clicking on “I disagree with the scan results” and checking on “I want to receive an email notification”.

Please review it carefully. This notice is effective as of April 14, 2003.

This Joint Notice of Privacy Practices is being provided to you on behalf of Shady Grove Fertility Reproductive Science Center and Integramed America, Inc. with respect to reproductive medicine services provided at Shady Grove Fertility Reproductive Science Center or any satellite facilities (collectively referred to herein as ""We"" or ""Our). We understand that your medical information is private and confidential. Further, we are required by law to maintain the privacy of ""protected health information."" Protected health information includes any individually identifiable information that we obtain from you or others that relates to your past, present or future physical or mental health, the health care you have received, or payment for your health care.

### Your Rights

Although your health record is the physical property of Shady Grove Fertility Reproductive Science Center, the information belongs to you.

You have the right to:

  * request a restriction on certain uses and disclosures of your information as provided by applicable law.
  * obtain a paper copy of the notice of information practices upon request
  * inspect and copy your health record as provided for by applicable law.
  * request to amend your health record as provided by applicable law.
  * obtain an accounting of disclosures of your health information as provided by applicable law.
  * request communications of your health information by alternative means or at alternative locations
  * revoke your authorization to use or disclose health information except to the extent that action has already been taken. 



### Our Responsibilities

We are required to:

  * maintain the privacy of your health information
  * provide you with a notice as to our legal duties and privacy practices with respect to information we collect and maintain about you
  * abide by the terms of this notice
  * notify you if we are unable to agree to a requested restriction
  * accommodate reasonable requests you may have to communicate health information by alternative means or at alternative locations.



We reserve the right to change our practices and to make the new provisions effective for all protected health information we maintain. Should our information practices change, we will mail a revised notice to the address you've supplied us. We will not use or disclose your health information without your authorization, except as described in this notice.

### Permitted Uses and Disclosures

We will use your health information for treatment. For example: Information obtained by a nurse, physician or other member of your healthcare team will be recorded in your record and used to determine the course of treatment that should work best for you. Your physician will document in your record his expectations of the members of your healthcare team. Members of your healthcare team will then record the actions they took and their observations. In that way the physician will know how you are responding to treatment.

We will also provide your physician or a subsequent healthcare provider with copies of various reports that should assist him/her in treating you once you're discharged from this practice.

We will use your health information for payment. For example: If you indicate your interest in participating in the Shared Risk Refund Program, we will provide relevant information concerning your medical condition to IntegraMed America, Inc. for determination of your qualifications for this payment assistance program.

A bill may be sent to you or a third party payer. The information on or accompanying the bill may include information that identifies you, as well as your diagnosis, procedures and supplies used.

We will use your health information for regular health operations. For example: Members of the clinical staff, the risk or quality improvement manager, or members of the quality improvement team may use information in your health record to assess the care and outcomes in your case and others like it. This information will then be used in an effort to continually improve the quality and effectiveness of the healthcare and the reproductive medicine service we provide.

We will collect health information on you and your spouse/significant other. For example: Although health information in your medical record belongs to you, it will contain some information pertaining to your spouse/significant other. This is because the treatment of infertility may focus on the couple, rather than the individual. We will share information with either partner, unless you indicate otherwise.

### Other Uses or Disclosures of Protected Health Information

Business Associates: There are some services provided at Shady Grove Fertility Reproductive Science Center through contacts with business associates. Examples include: the management services of IntegraMed America, certain laboratory tests, and the services of transcription companies or billing companies. When these services are contracted, we may disclose your health information to our business associates so that they can perform the job we have asked them to do, and bill you or your third party payer for services rendered. So that your health information is protected, however, we require the business associates to appropriately safeguard your information.

Notification: We may use or disclose information to notify or assist in notifying a family member, personal representative, or another person responsible for your care, your location, and general condition.

Communication with Spouse/ Family: Health professionals, using their best judgment, may disclose to your spouse, family member, or any other person you identify, health information relevant to that person's involvement in your care or payment related to your care. We will give you an opportunity to object to these disclosures, and we will not make these disclosures if you object.

Research: We may disclose information to researchers when their research has been approved by an Institutional Review Board that has reviewed the research proposal and established protocols to ensure the privacy of your health information. In most cases, we will de-identify your patient information so that others can use the de-identified information to study reproductive health care and health care delivery without learning who you are.

Marketing: We may contact you to tell you about or recommend possible treatment alternatives or other reproductive medicine technology and services that may be of interest to you.

Food and Drug Administration (FDA): We may disclose to the FDA health information relative to adverse events with respect to food, supplements, product and product defects or post marketing surveillance information to enable product recalls, repairs or replacement.

Public Health: As required by law, we may disclose your health information to public health or legal authorities charged with preventing or controlling disease, injury or disability. Data from your assisted reproductive technology (ART) procedure will also be provided to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The 1992 Fertility Clinics Success Rate and Certification Act requires that the CDC collect data on all ART cycles performed in the United States annually and report success rates using these data. Because sensitive information will be collected on you, the CDC applied for and received an ""assurance of confidentiality"" for this project under the provisions of the Public Health Service Act, Section 308(d). This means that any information that the CDC has that identifies you will not be disclosed to anyone else without your authorization.

Law Enforcement: We may disclose health information for law enforcement purposes as required by law, or in response to a valid subpoena. Federal law makes provision for your health information to be released to an appropriate health oversight agency, public health authority or attorney, provided that a workforce member or business associate believes in good faith that we have engaged in unlawful conduct or have otherwise violated professional or clinical standards and are potentially endangering one or more patients, workers or the public.

Note: HIV-related information, genetic information, mental health records and other specially protected health information may enjoy certain special confidentiality protections under applicable State and Federal law. Any disclosures of these types of records will be subject to these special protections.

What types of information do we collect?  
  
| 

  
SEEK Commercial gathers two types of information about you, namely:

a.        aggregated information generated by our systems (or third party systems) to track our website traffic but that which does not identify you personally; and 

b.       personal information about you such as your name, address, telephone and facsimile number, email address and in some cases, your billing details and general financial and credit information. 

The type of information that SEEK Commercial collects about you is dependent on how you use the services offered on our website and the products you are interested in purchasing through SEEK Commercial.

Generally, SEEK Commercial does not collect 'sensitive information' about you. Sensitive information includes (but is not limited to) information about your race or ethnic origin, your religion and your sexual preferences. SEEK Commercial will only collect sensitive information about you in the event that it is necessary for the purpose of providing you with a product or service. In such circumstances, SEEK Commercial will only collect sensitive information with your consent unless we are required by law to collect such information from you.

Collection of aggregate data  
SEEK Commercial also collects non-personal information in aggregate form to track data such as the total number of visits to our website, the number of visits to specific areas of our website and the domain names of our website visitors' internet service providers.

We use this information, which remains in aggregate form, to understand how our website visitors use our website so that we can constantly improve and enhance our services. We may also share this information with our partners for the purpose of providing you with optimal services.

Like many website operators, SEEK Commercial uses the independent company Nielsen//NetRatings to measure and analyse the internet usage across our websites. We use Nielsen//NetRatings' services to collect the following types of information:

·                   the number of page views that occur on our website; 

·                   the number of unique browsers to our websites; 

·                   how long these unique browsers (on average) spend on our websites when they do visit; and 

·                   common entry and exit points of our websites. 

The Nielsen//NetRatings data is also accessible by media organisations and research companies, for the purpose of conducting industry comparisons with other internet portals.

Your Internet Provider (""IP"") address  
SEEK Commercial's web servers provide us with your IP address. This assists us in the diagnosis of problems and or support issues with our services.

Cookies and Applets  
SEEK Commercial uses 'cookies' and 'applets' in its website systems. These enable you to use services such as free demonstrations of our training courses. You are able to disable cookies and applets via your computer's web browser however this will restrict access to some web pages and services within the SEEK Commercial website.

What types of personal information do we collect about our guests?

We don’t require personal information to access our website.  But if you prefer not to disclose personal information, you may not be able to enjoy certain features of our website.  Personal information is information that identifies you and may be used to contact you. 

INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE TO US 

We will collect personal information from you when you use certain features on our website. For example, we collect personal information 

1.  | register for our website  
---|---  
2.  | subscribe to our newsletter  
3.  | participate in polls, surveys, and questionnaires  
4.  | participate in contests, sweepstakes, or other promotions  
5.  | use e-cards, wish lists, and tell-a-friend features   
6.  | register a product that you have purchased, or  
7.  | receive customer or technical support  
  
Typically, this information includes:

1.  | name  
---|---  
2.  | e-mail address  
3.  | telephone number  
4.  | shipping and billing address, and  
5.  | for those purchasing products online, credit card information.  
  
Additionally, we may also collect other types of information (known as demographic information) such as your age or date of birth, gender, hobbies, occupation, platform preferences, and other game ownership information.  This demographic information may be associated with your personal information.

If you are involved with our Merchant Center or Affiliate Center, we may request additional information to confirm the identity of you, your banking institution, or your business.

INFORMATION COLLECTED THROUGH TECHNOLOGY 

We collect information through technology to make our websites more interesting and secure.  For example, when you come to one of our websites, we collect your IP address.  An IP address is often associated with the portal through which you enter the Internet, like your ISP (Internet Service Provider), your company, or your university.  Standing alone, your IP address is not personally identifiable.  At times, we also use IP addresses to collect information regarding the frequency with which our guests visit various parts of our websites.  We may combine this information with your personal information.

COOKIES AND WEB BEACONS 

Our websites also use cookies and web beacons to collect and store personal information. 

Cookies are pieces of information that a website sends to your computer while you are viewing the website.  We use cookies for a variety of purposes.  For example, when you return to one of our websites after logging in, cookies provide information to the website so that the website will remember who you are.  You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies.  You can do this through your browser (like Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer) settings.  Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies.  If you turn cookies off, you won't have access to many features that make your web experience smoother, like the features mentioned above, and some of our services may not function properly.

Web beacons are small pieces of data that are embedded in images on the pages of websites and in our email communications.  We also use these web beacons to analyze the traffic patterns, such as the frequency users visit various areas of our websites.  These technical methods may involve transmitting information either directly to us or to another entity authorized by us to collect information on our behalf.  We also use web beacons in HTML e-mails that we send our guests to determine whether our guests have opened those e-mails or clicked on links in those e-mails. 

NETWORK ADVERTISERS 

Advertisements that are managed by third parties may be placed on our website.  These companies are called “network advertisers.”  Network advertisers who may place advertisements on our websites may also use cookies and web beacons to collect non-personal information when you click on or move your cursor over one of their banner advertisements. You may not realize this information is being collected.  In some cases, we may have access to information from web beacons and cookies used by network advertisers on our sites and this information may permit us to identify other sites that you have visited that are also associated with the network advertiser.

Finally, once you've clicked on an advertisement or third party logo and have left our websites, our Privacy Policy no longer applies and you must read the privacy policy of the advertiser to see how your personal information will be handled on their website.

How is your personal information used and shared?

Whatever the purpose may be, we will only collect information to the extent reasonably necessary to fulfill your requests and our legitimate business objectives. 

K2 ACTIVITES AND UPDATES 

We use the personal information we collect to:

1.  | respond to your requests for information and newsletters,  
---|---  
2.  | provide you with product support and customer services,  
3.  | determine if you are eligible to receive certain products or services,  
4.  | provide you with additional information that may be of interest, including marketing materials, and  
5.  | for other everyday business purposes, such as product development and website administration.  
  
We don’t share your personal information (e.g., e-mail address) with unaffiliated third parties to use for their direct marketing purposes.

We will be sharing some of your personal information about you that you provide when registering for LaMB games with SPE Networks – Asia Pte. Ltd. (“SPE”) for their marketing and promotional purposes if you have opted-in. Use and disclosure of your personal information by SPE will be governed by SPE’s privacy policy (http://www.animax-asia.com/privacy-policy) and will not be governed by K2’s privacy policy."" 

E-CARDS

When you send an e-card, we delete both sender and recipient email address information after sending your e-card.

FORUMS AND MESSAGE BOARDS 

If you register for access to our forums or message boards, we may use your personal information to enable you to view and post messages on the boards.  You should understand, however, that community forums, blogs, and message boards are tools that allow you to communicate with members of the online community.  So whenever you give out personal information in public areas, that information can be collected and used by people you don’t know.

SERVICE PROVIDERS 

We occasionally employ other companies to perform services necessary to our internal operations.  For example, we may partner with other companies to personalize our web pages, analyze customers’ interaction with our website, and process consumer surveys.  We may also provide postal addresses to the U.S. Post Office or other couriers for delivery purposes.  While providing services for us, these companies may access your personal information.  Those companies storing or maintaining personal information for us have agreed to use secure methods. 

BUSINESS INFORMATION 

For practical reasons, we treat personal information submitted to us in a business capacity different from information we receive in a non-business capacity.  Personal information submitted to us in a business capacity (e.g. resumes, event sponsorship, etc.) may be shared with third parties, depending on the nature of the inquiry. 

PURCHASE OR SALE OF BUSINESS 

From time to time, we may purchase a business or sell one or more of our businesses and your personal information may be transferred as a part of the purchase or sale.  If we purchase a business, the personal information received with that business would be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy, if it is practicable and permissible to do so.  If we sell a business, we will include provisions in the selling contract requiring the purchaser to treat your personal information in the same way required by this Privacy Policy (including any amendments to this Privacy Policy).  The provisions of this paragraph will also apply if we are sold as part of bankruptcy proceedings.

DISCLOSURES REQUIRED BY LAW AND DISCLOSURES TO HELP PROTECT THE SECURITY AND SAFETY OF OUR WEBSITES AND OTHERS 

Please note that we may disclose any information as permitted or required by law, when we believe in good faith it is necessary for safety purposes, required for legal reporting, or to protect our legal rights or enforce our Terms of Use or any contest rules.  We may also disclose information about you to our auditors or legal advisors, or in response to a subpoena. 

AGGREGATE INFORMATION 

We may take your personal information and make it non-personally identifiable.  We do this either by combining it with information about other individuals (aggregating your information with information about other individuals), and by removing characteristics (e.g., your name) that make the information personally identifiable to you.  This process is known as de-personalizing your information.  We may use de-personalized information in any way and share it with third parties.

K2 Network’s Kids Privacy Policy

Last updated April 15, 2010

K2 Network has developed its websites with the goal of creating an enjoyable experience for all users.  This Kids Privacy Policy is designed to answer your questions regarding our privacy policies concerning children under the age of 13.

Building on our general Privacy Policy, we recognize the need to provide additional privacy protections when children visit sites on which we post this Kids Privacy Policy.  We explain those additional protections in this Kids Privacy Policy. 

The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) requires that we inform parents and legal guardians about how we collect, use, and disclose personal information from kids under 13 years of age.  COPPA also requires us to obtain the consent of parents and guardians for children under 13 years of age to use certain features of our Web sites.  Below we explain how we do that for kids.  Also, when we use the term “parent” below, we mean to include legal guardians. 

This certification seal shown on this page confirms that K2 Network is a member in good standing of ESRB’s Privacy Online Program.  ESRB’s Privacy Online Program is designed to ensure that our website’s information disclosure practices are responsible and appropriate.  To protect your privacy, we have voluntarily undertaken this privacy initiative and all of our websites have been reviewed and certified by ESRB Privacy Online to meet established online information collection and use practices.  As part of this privacy program, ESRB independently audits our websites, and administers other enforcement and accountability mechanisms.

What types of information do we collect about kids?

Kids can surf K2 Network’s sites, view content, and enjoy many features without having to disclose any personal information.  We don’t collect personal information from kids while they use our sites unless they register on K2 Network’s sites’ Official Forums. 

For those who choose to register and participate in certain areas of our website, we collect personal information directly from kids to: 

1.  | register for our Official Forum  
---|---  
2.  | participate in polls, surveys, and questionnaires on the Official Forum  
  
We may collect personal information from parents to allow kids to participate in certain activities offered on our websites and within our kids' subscription products.  These activities may include purchasing product in one of our online stores, participating in games, reward programs, contests, sweepstakes, events or other promotions. 

Typically, this information includes:

1.  | name  
---|---  
2.  | email address  
3.  | telephone number  
4.  | shipping and billing address, and  
5.  | for those purchasing products online, credit card information.  
  
We may collect demographic information (e.g., date of birth, gender, and game preferences) and combine it with the child’s personal information.  K2 Network will only collect this information if it is voluntarily and properly submitted to us by either the child or parent. 

Note that all commercial sites directed to children under 13 are prohibited by U.S. law from conditioning a kid’s participation in an online activity on the kid's providing more personal information than is reasonably necessary. 

Some areas of our website may offer features like electronic postcards that allow kids to submit personal information (e.g., email address) without first disclosing their age or obtaining verifiable parental consent.  These areas provide services in a way that doesn’t require prior verifiable parental consent. 

Finally, we may collect demographic information about kids.  For example, if a kid participates in a survey, we may collect those responses.  Among them, we may collect age, gender, hobbies, and interests or other demographic information about gaming and preferences.  We also use some passive technologies, including cookies and web beacons, to monitor traffic on our websites.  This demographic information may be associated with a child’s personal information. 

back to top

How do we use and share the personally identifiable information that we collect from kids?

If a parent allows us to collect personal information about their kid, we may link certain information collected through technology (see the ""Information Collected Through Technology"" section of A2 of our General Privacy Policy) to that personal information. 

We may use the information that we collect from and about kids for our business purposes, including record-keeping, transaction fulfillment, and marketing.  The contact information gathered from a kid is used to obtain consent to our information collection from their parents. 

K2 Network may share kids’ personal information with outside entities hired to assist with internal website support operations (e.g., online product fulfillment, email services, or technical support).  These entities have agreed to maintain confidentiality, security, and integrity of all the personal information they obtain from us.

We do not share any information about a child with any third parties unless the disclosure is reasonably necessary to: 

1.  | comply with law, including, for example, to comply with a court order or subpoena;  
---|---  
2.  | enforce our Terms of Service, or site or game/promotion rules;  
3.  | in connection with the purchase or sale of assets, a merger, reorganization, bankruptcy, or similar corporate transaction; or  
4.  | protect the safety and security of our Guests and our Web sites.  
  
back to top

How do we notify and obtain consent from parents for the collection of personal information from their kids?

When a child under 13 attempts to register at our website, the child can download and print a parental consent form.  Then, you, as the parent, can fill out and sign the parental consent form and mail or fax it back to us.  If the parent ignores or refuses to register the child, we will delete all contact information from our database.  If the parent permits the registration, the child will be granted access to the features described in the notification message.

How can parents access, change or delete personally identifiable information about their kids?

At any time, a parent can contact our customer service department to access, change, or delete personal information we collected from his or her child by contacting us at:

Our representatives will take reasonable steps to verify your identity before disclosing your child’s information. 

back to top

What kinds of security measures do we take to safeguard kid's personally identifiable information?

We take the security and confidentiality of kids’ information very seriously.  We have implemented technical, administrative, and physical security measures to protect kids’ personal information from unauthorized access and improper use.  From time to time, we review our security procedures to consider appropriate new technology and methods.  But please understand that, despite our best efforts, no security measure is perfect or impenetrable.

How will we notify parents if our Kids Privacy Policy changes? 

At any time, we may amend our Kids Privacy Policy.  We will send e-mail notice to parents of any material changes in the way we intend to collect, use, or share kids' personal information.  At all times, parents should update their personal information to provide us current e-mail addresses.  We will apply material changes in our Kids Privacy Policy only in conformance with applicable law, including any applicable provisions of COPPA that require parental consent.

What types of personal information do we collect about our guests?

We don’t require personal information to access our website.  But if you prefer not to disclose personal information, you may not be able to enjoy certain features of our website.  Personal information is information that identifies you and may be used to contact you. 

INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE TO US 

We will collect personal information from you when you use certain features on our website. For example, we collect personal information 

1.  | register for our website  
---|---  
2.  | subscribe to our newsletter  
3.  | participate in polls, surveys, and questionnaires  
4.  | participate in contests, sweepstakes, or other promotions  
5.  | use e-cards, wish lists, and tell-a-friend features   
6.  | register a product that you have purchased, or  
7.  | receive customer or technical support  
  
Typically, this information includes:

1.  | name  
---|---  
2.  | e-mail address  
3.  | telephone number  
4.  | shipping and billing address, and  
5.  | for those purchasing products online, credit card information.  
  
Additionally, we may also collect other types of information (known as demographic information) such as your age or date of birth, gender, hobbies, occupation, platform preferences, and other game ownership information.  This demographic information may be associated with your personal information.

If you are involved with our Merchant Center or Affiliate Center, we may request additional information to confirm the identity of you, your banking institution, or your business.

INFORMATION COLLECTED THROUGH TECHNOLOGY 

We collect information through technology to make our websites more interesting and secure.  For example, when you come to one of our websites, we collect your IP address.  An IP address is often associated with the portal through which you enter the Internet, like your ISP (Internet Service Provider), your company, or your university.  Standing alone, your IP address is not personally identifiable.  At times, we also use IP addresses to collect information regarding the frequency with which our guests visit various parts of our websites.  We may combine this information with your personal information.

COOKIES AND WEB BEACONS 

Our websites also use cookies and web beacons to collect and store personal information. 

Cookies are pieces of information that a website sends to your computer while you are viewing the website.  We use cookies for a variety of purposes.  For example, when you return to one of our websites after logging in, cookies provide information to the website so that the website will remember who you are.  You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies.  You can do this through your browser (like Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer) settings.  Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies.  If you turn cookies off, you won't have access to many features that make your web experience smoother, like the features mentioned above, and some of our services may not function properly.

Web beacons are small pieces of data that are embedded in images on the pages of websites and in our email communications.  We also use these web beacons to analyze the traffic patterns, such as the frequency users visit various areas of our websites.  These technical methods may involve transmitting information either directly to us or to another entity authorized by us to collect information on our behalf.  We also use web beacons in HTML e-mails that we send our guests to determine whether our guests have opened those e-mails or clicked on links in those e-mails. 

NETWORK ADVERTISERS 

Advertisements that are managed by third parties may be placed on our website.  These companies are called “network advertisers.”  Network advertisers who may place advertisements on our websites may also use cookies and web beacons to collect non-personal information when you click on or move your cursor over one of their banner advertisements. You may not realize this information is being collected.  In some cases, we may have access to information from web beacons and cookies used by network advertisers on our sites and this information may permit us to identify other sites that you have visited that are also associated with the network advertiser.

Finally, once you've clicked on an advertisement or third party logo and have left our websites, our Privacy Policy no longer applies and you must read the privacy policy of the advertiser to see how your personal information will be handled on their website.

back to top

How is your personal information used and shared?

Whatever the purpose may be, we will only collect information to the extent reasonably necessary to fulfill your requests and our legitimate business objectives. 

RELOADED GAMES ACTIVITES AND UPDATES 

We use the personal information we collect to:

1.  | respond to your requests for information and newsletters,  
---|---  
2.  | provide you with product support and customer services,  
3.  | determine if you are eligible to receive certain products or services,  
4.  | provide you with additional information that may be of interest, including marketing materials, and  
5.  | for other everyday business purposes, such as product development and website administration.  
  
We don’t share your personal information (e.g., e-mail address) with unaffiliated third parties to use for their direct marketing purposes.

We will be sharing some of your personal information about you that you provide when registering for LaMB games with SPE Networks – Asia Pte. Ltd. (“SPE”) for their marketing and promotional purposes if you have opted-in. Use and disclosure of your personal information by SPE will be governed by SPE’s privacy policy (http://www.animax-asia.com/privacy-policy) and will not be governed by Reloaded Games’s privacy policy."" 

E-CARDS

When you send an e-card, we delete both sender and recipient email address information after sending your e-card.

FORUMS AND MESSAGE BOARDS 

If you register for access to our forums or message boards, we may use your personal information to enable you to view and post messages on the boards.  You should understand, however, that community forums, blogs, and message boards are tools that allow you to communicate with members of the online community.  So whenever you give out personal information in public areas, that information can be collected and used by people you don’t know.

SERVICE PROVIDERS 

We occasionally employ other companies to perform services necessary to our internal operations.  For example, we may partner with other companies to personalize our web pages, analyze customers’ interaction with our website, and process consumer surveys.  We may also provide postal addresses to the U.S. Post Office or other couriers for delivery purposes.  While providing services for us, these companies may access your personal information.  Those companies storing or maintaining personal information for us have agreed to use secure methods. 

BUSINESS INFORMATION 

For practical reasons, we treat personal information submitted to us in a business capacity different from information we receive in a non-business capacity.  Personal information submitted to us in a business capacity (e.g. resumes, event sponsorship, etc.) may be shared with third parties, depending on the nature of the inquiry. 

PURCHASE OR SALE OF BUSINESS 

From time to time, we may purchase a business or sell one or more of our businesses and your personal information may be transferred as a part of the purchase or sale.  If we purchase a business, the personal information received with that business would be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy, if it is practicable and permissible to do so.  If we sell a business, we will include provisions in the selling contract requiring the purchaser to treat your personal information in the same way required by this Privacy Policy (including any amendments to this Privacy Policy).  The provisions of this paragraph will also apply if we are sold as part of bankruptcy proceedings.

DISCLOSURES REQUIRED BY LAW AND DISCLOSURES TO HELP PROTECT THE SECURITY AND SAFETY OF OUR WEBSITES AND OTHERS 

Please note that we may disclose any information as permitted or required by law, when we believe in good faith it is necessary for safety purposes, required for legal reporting, or to protect our legal rights or enforce our Terms of Use or any contest rules.  We may also disclose information about you to our auditors or legal advisors, or in response to a subpoena. 

AGGREGATE INFORMATION 

We may take your personal information and make it non-personally identifiable.  We do this either by combining it with information about other individuals (aggregating your information with information about other individuals), and by removing characteristics (e.g., your name) that make the information personally identifiable to you.  This process is known as de-personalizing your information.  We may use de-personalized information in any way and share it with third parties.

This may include using demographic data or trend data provided by third parties, where permitted. Contact details, including phone numbers and email addresses, may be used to contact you.

Interest-Based Ads  
We may provide information about your interests in our products to third parties for the purposes of serving you more relevant ads. Where we provide you with interest-based ads on a site other than our own, we do not track your other activities on that site. If you click on our ads, we will know only the domain you came from. For more information, please see the Tracking Technologies & Do Not Track section below.

Tracking Technologies & Do-No-Track Cookies 

### Cookies

A cookie is a commonly used automated data collection tool. Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer or device by websites that you visit or HTML-formatted emails you open, in order to make websites work, or work more efficiently.

We and our partners may use cookies, web beacons, pixel tags, scripts or other similar technologies on our websites or emails to, among other things:  
• Tailor information presented to you based on your browsing preferences, such as language and geographical region;  
• Collect statistics regarding your website usage;  
• Provide us with business and marketing information; and  
• In some cases, to enable a third party to deliver future advertising for our products and services to you when you visit certain websites owned by third parties.

We use different kinds of cookies:  
• Essential cookies are necessary to provide you with services and features available through our websites. Without these cookies, services you may need, such as shopping carts or e-billing, cannot be provided.  
• Analytics or customization cookies collect information that is either used in aggregate form to help us understand how the website is being used or how effective our marketing campaigns are, or to help us customize the website for you.  
• Advertising cookies and tracking scripts are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you. They perform functions like preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly delivered and, in some cases, featuring ads based on your interests. To opt-out of our cookies used for online advertising provided directly by Norton.com, click here.

If your website includes a cookie management tool, you will find a hover button at the bottom of your screen.

If you do not wish to receive cookies you may be able to refuse them by adjusting your browser settings to reject cookies. If you do so, we may be unable to offer you some of our functionalities, services or support. If you have previously visited our websites, you may also have to delete any existing cookies from your browser.

We gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information may include Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data.

We may combine this log information with other information we collect about you. We do this to improve services we offer you, to improve marketing, analytics, or site functionality.

We use Local Storage, such as HTML5, to store content information and preferences. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our website or to display advertising based upon your web browsing activity also use HTML5 to collect and store information. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5.

### Do-Not-Track

There are different ways you can prevent tracking of your online activity. One of them is setting a preference in your browser that alerts websites you visit that you do not want them to collect certain information about you. This is referred to as a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) signal.

Please note that our websites may not recognize or take action in response to DNT signals from Web browsers. At this time, there is no universally accepted standard for what a company should do when a DNT signal is detected. In the event a final standard is established, we will assess how to appropriately respond to these signals.

For more detailed information about cookies, Do-Not-Track and other tracking technologies, please visit allaboutcookies.org and allaboutdnt.com.

### Third Party Data Collection

This may also include cookies placed by third parties, to deliver tailored information and content which may be of interest to you, such as promotions or offerings, when you visit third party websites after you have left our websites. We do not permit these third parties to collect personal information about you (such as email address) on our site, nor do we disclose with them any personal information about you.  


### Social Media Features and Widgets

Our websites include social media features, such as Facebook’s “Like” button, and widgets, such as the “Share This” button, or interactive mini-programs that run on our site. These features are usually recognizable by their third party brand or logo and may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our websites, and set a cookie to enable the feature to work properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our site. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.

How We Disclose Your Information 

We do not sell, lease, rent or give away Your Information. We only disclose Your Information as described below, within our group of companies, with our partners, with service providers that process information on our behalf and with law enforcement. Processing is only undertaken for the purposes described in this Statement. If we disclose Your Information, we require those we disclose it with to comply with adequate privacy and confidentiality requirements, and security standards.  


### Partners

We may provide Your Information to our partners for the sole purpose of allowing them to conduct Symantec business. Our partners go through a certification process and only after that are they authorized to promote and sell our products and services. Our partners may use Your Information to communicate with you and others about Symantec products or services.

If you do not wish to receive promotional emails from our partners, you can unsubscribe directly in the footer of the partner’s email to you.

### Service Providers Processing Data On Our Behalf  


We may use contractors and service providers to process Your Information on our behalf for the purposes described in this Statement. We contractually require service providers to keep information secure and confidential and we do not allow our data processors to disclose your information to others without our  
authorization, or to use it for their own purposes. However, if you have an independent relationship with these service providers their privacy statements will apply.  


### Law Enforcement  


In certain instances, it may be necessary for Symantec to disclose Your personal information to government officials or otherwise as required by applicable law. No personal information will be disclosed to any law enforcement agency or governmental agency except in response to:  
• A subpoena, warrant or other process issued by a court of competent jurisdiction;  
• A legal process having the same consequence as a court-issued request for information, in that if Symantec were to refuse to provide such information, it would be in breach of local law, and it or its officers, executives or employees would be subject to liability for failing to honor such legal process;  
• Where such disclosure is necessary for Symantec to enforce its legal rights pursuant to the laws of the jurisdiction from which such information was gathered;  
• A request for information with the purpose of identifying and/or preventing credit card fraud; or  
• Where such disclosure is necessary to prevent or lessen a serious and imminent threat of bodily harm to the data subject.  


### Transfer Among Symantec Entities  


We are a global company and, as such, we process information in many countries. To conduct our business, and in accordance with this Statement, Your Information may be transferred to Symantec Corporation in the United States, or to subsidiaries of Symantec Corporation, which may be located in Europe, the Middle East, Africa or Asia Pacific. All transfers will occur in compliance with data transfer requirements of applicable laws and regulations.

In the process of continuing to develop our business, we may acquire subsidiaries or other business entities. As a result of such transactions, and for the purpose of maintaining a continued relationship with you, we may transfer Your Information to a related affiliate. If we are involved in a reorganization, merger, acquisition or sale of our assets, Your Information may be transferred as part of that deal. We will notify you of any such deal and outline your choices in that event.

How We Protect Your Information 

We have taken appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect Your Information from misuse, unauthorized or unlawful access or disclosure, loss, alteration, damage or destruction. These measures include:

Physical safeguards, with locked doors and file cabinets, controlled access to our facilities and secure destruction of media containing your information.

Technology safeguards, like the use of Symantec anti-virus and endpoint protection software, encryption, and monitoring of our systems and data centers to ensure that they comply with our security policies. For example, credit card information is transmitted using Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption.

Organizational safeguards, like training and awareness programs on security and privacy, to make sure employees understand the importance and means by which they must protect Your Information. Our organizational privacy policies and standards also guide our handling of Your Information.

Storage of Your Information  
The information we collect from you may be stored on servers in the United States and anywhere Symantec or our vendors operate.

Links to Other Websites  
Our websites may contain links to other websites, which are owned or operated by other companies. If you choose to visit any linked websites, we encourage you to review their privacy statements carefully, as they may differ from ours. We are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of websites that are owned by companies that are not within the Symantec group of companies.

Our websites may also link to co-branded websites that are maintained by Symantec and one or more of our business partners, who are collecting Your Information pursuant to their own privacy practices. We encourage you to read the privacy statements on any co-branded site to which you link for information on the privacy practices of that site.

Children’s Privacy  
Our site is not directed to, nor do we knowingly collect information from, children under the age of 13.

1\.  General

Thank you for visiting www.4utah.com, which is operated by KTVX/KUCW, an affiliate of Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. and Mission Broadcasting, Inc. (?we,? ?us? or ?our?).  We respect the privacy of visitors to our websites (each a ?Site? and collectively the ?Sites?).  Because we gather certain types of information that can uniquely identify a specific individual (?Personal Information?) from users of our Sites, we feel that you should know how we collect, use, disclose, manage and store your Personal Information. This Privacy Policy describes, among other things, the types of information collected about you when you visit our Sites; how your information may be used and when it may be disclosed; how you can control the use and disclosure of your information; and how your information is protected.

 This Privacy Policy does not apply to any information you may provide to us offline or through any means other than our Sites.  For example, this Privacy Policy does not apply to information that you provide to us at a live event, or when you respond by postal mail or telephone to a survey or an invitation to enter a sweepstakes or contest, or to any other instances in which we may collect information from you offline.  This Privacy Policy also does not cover any information collected through any other website, even if the other website is linked to our Sites. 

Please read this Privacy Policy carefully so that you understand our online privacy practices. Your continued participation on our Sites indicates your acceptance of this Privacy Policy and of the collection, use, disclosure, management and storage of your Personal Information as described below.  By visiting our Sites, you agree that your visit and any dispute regarding our privacy practices is governed by this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use. 

From time to time we may revise this Privacy Policy to reflect industry initiatives or changes in the law, our Personal Information collection and use practices, the features of the Sites or technology.  Your continued use of the Sites after we post a revised Privacy Policy signifies your acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy.  It is therefore important that you review this Privacy Policy regularly to ensure you are updated as to any changes.

2\.  Your Disclosure of Information to Us

We believe that we can enhance your experience on our Sites through the information you share with us.  However, you may choose to enjoy some of the content and features on our Sites without directly providing us with any information about you; but, as described below, some information is automatically collected when you visit our Sites.  In addition, in order for you to take advantage of certain features and services offered on our Sites, you may be required to provide us with Personal Information.

The Sites provide certain activities where we gather Personal Information from users of the Sites, such as an activity that requires that a user complete a registration process and receive/select a ?user name? and password.  Registration to participate in these Site activities may require the submission of your email address, zip code, date of birth and other Personal Information.  Other Personal Information that may be submitted include your full name, postal address, phone number, password hints, gender, personal interests, industry you work in, occupation/role, household income, communication preferences, preferred news source, and any other information you provide to us in order to use a Site feature or service.  If you choose to make a purchase or sign up for a paid subscription service, we will ask for additional information, such as your credit card number and billing address.   You may also provide us with photographs or video materials that contain personal information about you.  In addition, you may have the ability to opt-in to additional subscription services, such as email news alerts or promotional and marketing information to be received directly from our advertisers (those who pay us to place advertisements on our Sites) which may require you to provide certain Personal Information. 

We do not collect Personal Information about individuals except when specifically and knowingly provided by such individuals except where you submit such information on their behalf (for example, if you submit a birthday notice with the person?s name and email address).  For certain activities you may be asked to submit a person?s name, address, phone number or email address.

In addition to the information that you may provide to us, our servers also automatically collect information about you or your computer, including your browser type, operating system and computer monitor resolution; your Internet Protocol (IP) address (the number automatically assigned to your computer whenever you access the Internet and that can sometimes be used to derive your general geographic area); sites you visited before and after visiting our Sites; web pages and advertisements you view and links you click on our Sites; unique identifiers, including mobile device identification numbers, that can identify the physical location of such devices in accordance with applicable law; information collected through cookies, web beacons, and other technologies; information about your interactions with video content, such as the type of content viewed, and information about your interactions with email messages, such as the links clicked on and whether the messages were opened or forwarded; and standard server log information.

We also may collect information about you from other sources, including through interactive applications (such as mobile devices, third-party services, and embedded video players), from co-branded partners, and from commercially available sources (such as data aggregators and public databases).

Unless otherwise provided in a separate registration page, we do not request for marketing purposes contact information for a mobile phone, text messaging or any wireless device that includes a domain name address (such as ?wireless.bellsouth.com?) as part of the contact information.  Federal law prohibits the sending of commercial marketing email messages directly to a wireless device that uses a domain name, unless you have first given your affirmative consent.  We may inadvertently collect a wireless device number that includes a domain name when you send us an inquiry or register for a contest or membership club.  However, we will not knowingly use that contact information for sending commercial marketing email.  We reserve the right to respond to user inquiries or requests sent via a wireless device that uses a domain name, as such messages are not deemed to be commercial marketing email.

Our third party service providers, advertisers and affiliates may use cookies, web beacons and other similar technologies to manage or measure the performance of their information displayed or delivered over our Sites.  For more information regarding this use, please see our ?Links to Third Party Websites? section below.

We also may use technical methods in our HTML emails that we send to you to determine whether you have opened or forwarded an email and/or clicked on links in those emails, to customize the display of banner advertising and other messages to you, to determine whether you have made an inquiry or purchase in response to a particular email and other similar activities.  These technical methods may enable us to collect and use your Personal Information.

4.  Social Networking

You also can engage with our content, such as video, games, applications, and other offerings, on or through third-party social networking sites, such as Facebook, Twitter and other third-party social media plug-ins and applications.

We may share information, including your Personal Information, with our affiliates, service providers and advertisers.  We also may disclose your Personal Information in response to a court order or subpoena, in response to a law enforcement agency request; when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) our rights or to anyone that could be harmed by such activities; in situations involving threats to the physical safety of any person; where it is necessary to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activity or suspected fraud; or as otherwise required by law.  We may transfer Personal Information about you if we are acquired by, sold to or merged with another company. 

Our agents and contractors who have access to your Personal Information are required to protect the information in a manner consistent with our Privacy Policy and may not use the information for any other purposes other than to carry out the activity they are performing on our behalf.  However, we may disclose your Personal Information to third parties who are not covered by this Privacy Policy (e.g., marketers, retailers, non-profit organizations, participatory databases) that want to market products or services to you.  We may also share your non-personally identifiable information with third parties in order to provide you with more relevant product and service opportunities.

We may share aggregated or anonymized information with third parties.  This information cannot be used to individually identify you.  Much of the information we collect is in the form of aggregated statistics, such as the traffic generated by visits on various pages within our Sites, and the habits and preferences of our audience.  Such aggregated information does not include any information that would identify you personally. We may use such aggregated information and disclose it to third parties as we see fit.

If you have signed up to receive our emails and prefer not to receive marketing information from our Sites, follow the unsubscribe instructions provided on any such email you receive from our Sites.

This Privacy Policy addresses only our use of information we collect from you online.   It does not apply to information you choose to disclose to other parties whether through chat rooms, forums, personal ads or interactive areas of our Sites that allow you to submit or post your own content or the like.  We cannot prevent such information from being used in a manner that may violate this Privacy Policy, the law, or your personal privacy and safety.  Accordingly, information you disclose on message boards, in chat rooms and forums, through content you provide or in any other way can be viewed, collected and/or used by others and we are not responsible for information you disclose in this manner.

Any such transmission is done at your own risk.

1\.  General

Thank you for visiting Good4Utah.com, which is operated by KTVX, an affiliate of Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. and Mission Broadcasting, Inc. (“we,” “us” or “our”).  We respect the privacy of visitors to our websites, mobile sites, and applications (each a “Property” and collectively the “Properties”).  Because we gather certain types of information that can uniquely identify a specific individual (“Personal Information”) from users of our Properties, we feel that you should know how we collect, use, disclose, manage and store your Personal Information. This Privacy Policy describes, among other things, the types of information collected about you when you visit our Properties; how your information may be used and when it may be disclosed; how you can control the use and disclosure of your information; and how your information is protected.

 This Privacy Policy does not apply to any information you may provide to us offline or through any means other than our Properties.  For example, this Privacy Policy does not apply to information that you provide to us at a live event, or when you respond by postal mail or telephone to a survey or an invitation to enter a sweepstakes or contest, or to any other instances in which we may collect information from you offline.  This Privacy Policy also does not cover any information collected through any other site or application even if the other site or application is linked to our Properties. 

Please read this Privacy Policy carefully so that you understand our online privacy practices. Your continued use of, and/or participation on, our Properties indicates your acceptance of this Privacy Policy and of the collection, use, disclosure, management and storage of your Personal Information as described below.  By visiting our Properties, you agree that your visit and any dispute regarding our privacy practices is governed by this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use. 

From time to time we may revise this Privacy Policy to reflect industry initiatives or changes in the law, our Personal Information collection and use practices, the features of the Properties or technology.  Your continued use of, and/or participation on, the Properties after we post a revised Privacy Policy signifies your acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy.  It is therefore important that you review this Privacy Policy regularly to ensure you are updated as to any changes.

2\.  Your Disclosure of Information to Us

Information Provided Directly to Us.

We believe that we can enhance your experience on our Properties through the information you share with us.  However, you may choose to enjoy some of the content and features on our Properties without directly providing us with any information about you; but, as described below, some information is automatically collected when you visit our Properties.  In addition, in order for you to take advantage of certain features and services offered on our Properties, you may be required to provide us with Personal Information.

The Properties provide certain activities where we gather Personal Information from users of the Properties, such as an activity that requires that a user complete a registration process and receive/select a “user name” and password.  Registration to participate in these Property activities may require the submission of your email address, zip code, date of birth and other Personal Information.  Other Personal Information that may be submitted include your full name, postal address, phone number, password hints, gender, personal interests, industry you work in, occupation/role, household income, communication preferences, preferred news source, and any other information you provide to us in order to use a Property feature or service.  If you choose to make a purchase or sign up for a paid subscription service, we will ask for additional information, such as your credit card number and billing address.   You may also provide us with photographs or video materials that contain Personal Information about you.  In addition, you may have the ability to opt-in to additional subscription services, such as email news alerts or promotional and marketing information to be received directly from our advertisers (those who pay us to place advertisements on our Properties) which may require you to provide certain Personal Information. 

We also may collect Personal Information about you when such information is provided by another individual on your behalf (for example, if another individual submits a birthday notice with your name and email address).  For certain activities you may be asked to submit a person’s name, address, phone number or email address.

Information Collected Automatically.

In addition to the information that you may provide to us, our Properties also automatically collect information about you or your computer, including your browser type, operating system and computer monitor resolution; your Internet Protocol (IP) address (the number automatically assigned to your computer whenever you access the Internet and that can sometimes be used to derive your general geographic area); sites and/or applications you visited before and after visiting our Properties; web pages and advertisements you view and links you click on our Properties; unique identifiers, including mobile device identification numbers, that can identify the physical location of such devices in accordance with applicable law; information collected through cookies, web beacons, and other technologies; information about your interactions with video content, such as the type of content viewed, and information about your interactions with email messages, such as the links clicked on and whether the messages were opened or forwarded; and standard server log information.

Information Obtained from Other Sources.

Where permitted by applicable law, we also may obtain non-personally identifiable information and/or Personal Information about you from other sources, including through interactive applications (such as mobile devices, third-party services, and embedded video players), from co-branded partners, and sites/applications (for example, on our pages on Facebook), and from commercially available sources (such as data aggregators and public databases).

Combining Information.

Please note that all of the information we collect about you may be combined, including to help us tailor our communications to you and to develop rich online content and services across the Properties.

Wireless Device Information.

Unless otherwise provided in a separate registration page, we do not request for marketing purposes contact information for a mobile phone, text messaging or any wireless device that includes a domain name address (such as “wireless.bellsouth.com”) as part of the contact information.  Federal law prohibits the sending of commercial marketing email messages directly to a wireless device that uses a domain name, unless you have first given your affirmative consent.  We may inadvertently collect a wireless device number that includes a domain name when you send us an inquiry or register for a contest or membership club.  However, we will not knowingly use that contact information for sending commercial marketing email.  We reserve the right to respond to user inquiries or requests sent via a wireless device that uses a domain name, as such messages are not deemed to be commercial marketing email.

3.  Cookies and Similar Technologies

You should be aware that non-personally identifiable information and data may be automatically collected on the Properties through the use of “cookies,” web beacons and other similar technologies.  While such technologies do not contain Personal Information, once you choose to furnish our Properties with Personal Information, this information may be linked to the data stored in a cookie and such information may be used to personalize your experience with our Properties (for example, recognizing you by name when you return to a Property), saving your password in password protected areas or enabling you to use shopping carts on our Properties.  Web beacons and cookies may also be used to collect, aggregate and analyze anonymous tracking data to help measure and track traffic and general user behavior.  We may also use such technologies to help us offer you more relevant information or products and services of interest to you.  Cookies also identify you to our servers allowing you the opportunity to avoid reentering your email and password each time you access the Properties.

Our third party service providers, advertisers and affiliates may use cookies, web beacons and other similar technologies to manage or measure the performance of their information displayed or delivered over our Properties.  For more information regarding this use, please see our “Third Party Advertising / Links to Third Party Sites and/or Applications” section below.

If you do not want information collected through the use of “cookies” there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to deny or accept cookies.  You may set your browser to accept all or certain cookies, block all or certain cookies, or require your consent before accepting a cookie.  Blocking our cookies will affect your online experience and may prevent you from experiencing certain features of our Properties. 

We also may use technical methods in our HTML emails that we send to you to determine whether you have opened or forwarded an email and/or clicked on links in those emails, to customize the display of banner advertising and other messages to you, to determine whether you have made an inquiry or purchase in response to a particular email and other similar activities.  These technical methods may enable us to collect and use your Personal Information.

4.  Social Networking

You also can engage with our content, such as video, games, applications, and other offerings, on or through third-party social networking sites, such as Facebook, Twitter and other third-party social media plug-ins and applications. When you engage with our content on or through third party social networking sites, plug-ins and applications, you may allow us to have access to certain information from your social media profile (e.g., name, e-mail address, photo, gender, birthday, location, your list of friends, people you follow and/or who follow you, the posts or the “likes” you make) to deliver the content or as part of the operation of the application.  We may also obtain non-personally identifiable information (e.g., content viewed, game performance, high scores, and information about advertisements within the content you have been shown or may have clicked on,) from your interaction with our content.

When you provide information from your social media account, it can help enable us to do things like (1) give you exclusive content, (2) personalize your online experience with us within and outside our Properties, and (3) contact you through the social networking sites or directly by sending you the latest news, special offerings, and rewards.  By doing so, you consent to the use of this information in accordance with our Privacy Policy.  When you provide Personal Information to us through an application, on our Properties, or on social networking sites, it may be publicly viewed by other members of these sites and/or applications and we cannot prevent further use of the information by third parties.

Through some social networking sites’ privacy settings, you can control what data you share. For more information about how social networking sites handle your Personal Information, please refer to their privacy policies and terms of use.

5\. Our Use of Your Information

We use your Personal Information to provide you with features, services or goods, or information you request, to respond to your questions or comments related to us or the Properties, and to enable you to participate in features such as surveys, polls, sweepstakes, and message boards. We also use your Personal Information to notify you about updates, new features, programming and activities that may be of interest to you.  We may use the information to communicate with you when you have won a contest or sweepstakes, or to contact you about your account with us.  We use the information that you provide about others to enable us to send them your gifts or cards or emails you may wish to send them from our Properties.

We may use your information for hiring, operational and business purposes, or to find out how we can improve our company and Properties via surveys or online tracking mechanisms.  We may use aggregated Personal Information collected directly during the registration process and/or via cookies, web beacons, and other similar technologies to help us evaluate and modify existing services and features, as well as provide demographic and geographic information to advertisers.  We may also use your Personal Information to develop new services and features that may be of interest to you. 

We may use the information you provide about yourself or others to enforce the legal terms of use for our Properties and for any other purpose for which you provided the information.   

If you choose to submit content for publication we may publish your screen name and/or other information you have provided.

6\.  Our Disclosure of Your Information

We may share information, including your Personal Information, with our affiliates, service providers and advertisers.  We also may disclose your Personal Information in response to a court order or subpoena, in response to a law enforcement agency request; when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) our rights or to anyone that could be harmed by such activities; in situations involving threats to the physical safety of any person; where it is necessary to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activity or suspected fraud; or as otherwise required by law.  We may transfer Personal Information about you if we are acquired by, sold to or merged with another company. 

Our agents and contractors who have access to your Personal Information are required to protect the information in a manner consistent with our Privacy Policy and may not use the information for any other purposes other than to carry out the activity they are performing on our behalf.  However, we may disclose your Personal Information to third parties who are not covered by this Privacy Policy (e.g., marketers, retailers, non-profit organizations, participatory databases) that want to market products or services to you.  We may also share your non-personally identifiable information with third parties in order to provide you with more relevant product and service opportunities.

When you choose to enter a sweepstakes, contest, or other promotion, and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the promotion, your Personal Information may be disclosed to sponsors and third parties who help administer the promotion, including in connection with winner selection and prize fulfillment.  Your Personal Information also may be disclosed as required by law, such as on a winners list.  Also, by entering a promotion, you are agreeing to the official rules that govern that promotion, including allowing the sponsors to use your name, voice, and likeness in advertising and marketing associated with the promotion in accordance with applicable law.

Our Properties may offer shopping services, which may be offered by us or by a firm that operates a store under contract with us. If our Properties offer shopping or other commercial services, you will be asked to use a customer order form to request information, products, and services. The order form will ask you to give us contact information (like name or email address), financial information (like account or credit card numbers), and demographic information (like zip code or age).  We will use the financial information that you provide to bill you for products and services. By giving us your credit card and related personal information, you are authorizing our store to give that information to the merchant and the credit card company in order to confirm and fulfill your order.  We will use contact information from the order form to fulfill your orders. We may also use contact data to get in touch with you when necessary. We will not otherwise use or distribute your financial information without your prior approval. 

We and our Properties continue to expand our online presence in order to offer users rich and deep interactive experiences.  We may share information we collect about you among our Properties so that we can provide you with information about products and services that might interest you.

We may share aggregated or anonymized information with third parties.  This information cannot be used to individually identify you.  Much of the information we collect is in the form of aggregated statistics, such as the traffic generated by visits on various pages within our Properties, and the habits and preferences of our audience.  Such aggregated information does not include any information that would identify you personally. We may use such aggregated information and disclose it to third parties as we see fit.

If you have signed up to receive our emails and prefer not to receive marketing information from our Properties, follow the unsubscribe instructions provided on any such email you receive from our Properties.

This Privacy Policy addresses only our use of information we collect from you online.   It does not apply to information you choose to disclose to other parties whether through chat rooms, forums, personal ads or interactive areas of our Properties that allow you to submit or post your own content or the like.  We cannot prevent such information from being used in a manner that may violate this Privacy Policy, the law, or your personal privacy and safety.  Accordingly, information you disclose on message boards, in chat rooms and forums, through content you provide or in any other way can be viewed, collected and/or used by others and we are not responsible for information you disclose in this manner. 

  
7.  Third Party Advertising / Links to Third Party Sites and/or Applications

We may sometimes offer content that is sponsored by or co-branded with identified third parties.  The Properties also may contain links to the sites and/or applications of third parties not affiliated with us, such as advertisers.  If you click on an advertiser’s advertisement, you will link to the advertiser’s site and/or application.  We may work with one or more advertisers, advertising agencies, advertising networks and/or audience segment providers to help deliver advertisements or other content on the Properties.  These third parties may utilize cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies on your computer or mobile or other device to serve you advertisements or content tailored to your perceived or stated interests and/or preferences based on information you provided, and/or your browsing behavior, on the Properties and/or other sites and applications you have visited.  These third parties also may use such technologies to help determine whether you previously have seen particular advertisements or content and to avoid sending you duplicates.  In doing so, these third parties collect non-personally identifiable information such as your browser type, your operating system, web pages visited, time of visits, content viewed, ads viewed, and other click stream data. 

In all of the above instances this Privacy Policy will not apply to any information collected by these third parties.  This collection of information is not under our control and such third party information practices may be different than ours.  Once you leave our Properties via such a link or by clicking on an advertisement, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the third parties or advertiser site or application to determine how they will handle any information that they collect from you.  You understand, acknowledge and agree that these links are provided solely as a convenience to you and not as an endorsement by us.  We are NOT responsible for the privacy practices or the content on any of these other sites or applications, including any sites or applications that may indicate a special relationship or “partnership” with us.  If you decide to access any of the third-party sites or applications linked to the Properties, you do so entirely at your own risk.

Further, these third parties may offer you a way to choose not to have your information used for advertising purposes. To manage your preference for internet advertising, please visit the Consumer Opt-Out Page.  

Please note that if you choose to opt out of having your information used to deliver advertisements tailored to your interests, you will continue to see advertisements on our Properties, but these advertisements may not be as relevant to you.

8\.  Your Choices Regarding Your Information.

We respect your privacy and your ability to choose what information you share with us.  If you receive any communication from us that you prefer not to receive you may opt out of receiving further communications from us.  To remove any Personal Information from our database or to not receive future e-mail communications from us, you may modify your contact options in your profile (if applicable) or send an e-mail to PrivacyAdministrator@nexstar.tv with the word “remove” in the subject line. 

You may “opt-out” altogether from providing us with any Personal Information by not registering on the Properties or for any Property sponsored promotion, contest or sweepstakes, etc.  Or you may choose to remove your name from our database at any time by deleting your registration profile.  You may also opt out of receiving commercial email or text messages by following the instructions contained in any such message.  However, even if you unsubscribe to commercial messages, we still may need to send you communications relating to your use of our Properties, such as service announcements. 

If you ask us to shut down your account or delete your information, we will disable your account within a reasonable period of time.  However, we may need to retain some information about you in order to satisfy our legal and security obligations.  For example, some of your information may remain in back-up storage even if you ask us to delete it. 

If you do not want your Personal Information shared with third parties in the manner discussed in our “Disclosure of Your Information” section above, please notify Nexstar by telephone at (972) 373-8800, by e-mail to PrivacyAdministrator@nexstar.tv or at the following address:

We will provide you with a list of your Personal Information within thirty (30) calendar days from receipt of your request. There may be certain instances when we may not be able to provide the Personal Information, such as when access would violate the privacy of another individual or when access is prohibited by law.

10.  Your California Privacy Rights

California law allows California residents, once a year and free of charge, to request information about certain types of Personal Information (if any) that a business has disclosed to third parties for their direct marketing purposes in the prior calendar year.  However, under the law, we are not required to provide this information as long as we: (1) notify you that you have the right to prevent disclosure of Personal Information, and (2) provide you with a cost-free means to exercise that right.  As noted in this Privacy Policy, we require California residents to opt in to activities where we would share their Personal Information with third parties for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes.  If you are a California resident and you would like to prevent disclosure of your Personal Information for use in direct marketing by a third party, do not opt in to participate in these activities.  If you are a California resident, and you have opted in to one of these activities, but you later decide that you would like to discontinue our disclosure of your Personal Information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes, please see our opt-out procedures set forth above in “Your Choices Regarding Your Information” section for information regarding how to discontinue such disclosure.

Additionally, if you are a California resident under the age of 18, and a registered user of any Property where this Privacy Policy is posted, you may request and potentially obtain removal of content or Personal Information you have publicly posted. To make such a request, please send an e-mail to caleraser@nexstar.tv. All requests must provide: (a) a detailed description of the specific content or Personal Information you want removed; (b) information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the content or Personal Information, including but not limited to the name and URL (if applicable) of the Property where such information is located; and (c) your registered username and contact information reasonably sufficient to contact you if we have questions. We shall not accept requests via postal mail, telephone, or facsimile. We are not responsible for requests that are not properly sent, and may not be able to respond or take appropriate action if you do not provide complete information. Please also note that requests for removal do not ensure removal of the content or Personal Information you have posted, and there may be circumstances in which the law does not require or allow for removal even if requested.

11\.  Security of Information

We take reasonable security precautions to secure the Personal Information that you choose to provide against the loss, misuse, alteration or unauthorized access of such information.  Unfortunately, no transmission of data over the Internet is guaranteed to be completely secure. It may be possible for third parties not under our control to intercept or access transmissions or private communications unlawfully.  While we strive to protect your Personal Information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any Personal Information that you transmit to us. Any such transmission is done at your own risk. 

We do not and will not ever request your login information, password or credit card information in an unsecured or unsolicited email or telephone communication.  This practice is commonly known as “phishing.”  For more information about “phishing” and protecting your Personal Information from identity theft, you may want to visit the Federal Trade Commission at www.ftc.gov.

Our Properties are intended for a general audience and we do not knowingly collect or store contact information about children under the age of 13.  We may ask for a birth date to ensure that we are not collecting information from children under 13 or to identify when additional steps may need to be taken in connection with information collected from children under 18.  In those instances where we have actual knowledge that we are collecting information from children or the Properties offer a service directed toward children, we will comply with applicable laws, including the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act.

This information does not identify you personally. Our advertising companies use the information they collect about your use of their clients' Web sites to customize the advertisements you see when you visit their clients' Web sites.

### I. Information We Collect and How It Is Used

#### A. Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how we collect information from users of our Website, those who use our products and services (the “Services”) but do not have accounts (""Visitors""), and those register and subscribe to our services (""Members""). It describes what we do with the information we collect, and the choices Visitors and Members have concerning the collection and use of such information. We take special precautions and have implemented additional privacy safeguards when we collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. For more information about how we handle children’s information, please see the “Children’s Privacy” section below. 

#### B. Types Of Information We Collect

1\. We collect information from Visitors and Members who access various parts of our Website and use different Services in a variety of ways, including through a mobile device. As a result, the type of information we collect depends on the ways Visitors and Members interact with us, our Website and/or our Service(s). We may offer websites, services or applications that permit browsing and do not require registration. We may also offer Members the ability to access their accounts online and offline, which may result in collection of different data. 

2\. Information that we may collect about you through interactions includes information that you give us (such as your name, address, email address, telephone number, date of birth, other contact information, surveys and other information input into the Website); automatic information (data resulting from your activity, such as transaction information, IP address, log in, email, passwords and browsing activity); mobile information (location services); and information from other sources, such as social security numbers for contractors and instructors. We may also gather additional information such as the type of device and browser you are using, the IP address of your device, information about your device’s operating system, and additional information associated with your device and browsing activity. We may also gather information collected through cookies, tags, tracers, tracking scripts, web beacons, and other technologies, as described further below. 

3\. When we do collect personally identifiable information, we will use it for the purposes indicated in this policy. 

4\. Our Website may provide links to other websites that may have their own information collection practices. To the extent that you provide personally identifiable information to websites that link to or from our Website, different rules may apply to the use and disclosure of your personally identifiable information. To the extent that the Website includes third-party advertisements, the privacy policy of the advertiser providing the advertisement will govern the use of your personally identifiable information collected during your access to the advertisement. We do not control linking practices of advertisers or sponsors and do not monitor or claim responsibility for any content or privacy practices of such websites. Once you have left our Website, you must read the privacy policy of the advertiser or sponsor to see how your personally identifiable information will be handled. 

5\. On occasion, we may use an advertising server developed by a third party to display ads on our Website. Some of these ads may contain cookies that are set by third parties (advertisers, sponsors). We do not have access to these cookies or any information that they contain. This Privacy Policy does not cover any use of information that a third-party ad server may have collected from you. 

6\. We may use the Website as an entry into other networked web pages and websites operated by us and our subsidiaries and affiliates (together, the ""Transaction Sites”), such as for credit card processing. Please note that individual Transaction Sites may adopt privacy terms particular to the purpose of such Transaction Site or the transaction(s) taking place on such Transaction Site. As Transaction Sites are generally affiliated with commercial transactions that you or your business may have with us, particularly those which are password-protected or are subject to subscriptions, the privacy terms for such sites may differ through terms in separate agreements which may supplement or supersede these terms. 

#### C. Use of Registration and Visitor Information

1\. Registration may be allowed or required on the Website. Members are asked to provide certain personal information when they sign up for our Services including name, address, telephone number, email address and billing information (such as a credit card number and expiration date). The personal information collected from Members during the registration process is used to manage each Member's account (such as for billing purposes) and may be shared with other Members to coordinate Services. This information is not normally shared with unaffiliated third parties, unless specifically stated otherwise or in special circumstances. 

2\. We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. They have access to personal information gathered through the Services needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. 

3\. We may promote the Website, Services or a new service to members. You may manage your communication preferences within your account. 

4\. We may also generate non-identifying and aggregate profiles from personal information Members provide during registration (such as the total number, but not the names, of Members). As explained in more detail below, we may use this aggregated and non-identifying information to sell advertisements that appear on the Services. 

5\. While we make reasonable effort to prevent third party, non-affiliate access to personally identifiable information, you should keep in mind that data transmission over the Internet is not 100% secure and any information disclosed online can potentially be collected and used other than by the intended recipient. In view of the foregoing, we cannot warrant that your personally identifiable information will not be disclosed to or accessed by parties other than those authorized under this Privacy Policy. 

#### D. Email Marketing From Third Party Sponsors

We may send, on behalf of third parties, promotions via mail or email to some or all of our Members. However, in no event do we sell or otherwise transfer to third parties the email addresses of our subscribers. We strictly maintain the confidentiality of our subscribers' email addresses, except as stated in this Privacy Policy. In addition, users are always given the opportunity of opting-out of these promotions. 

#### E. Voluntary Customer Surveys

1\. We may periodically conduct both business and individual customer surveys. We encourage our customers to participate in these surveys because they provide us with important information that helps us to improve the types of services we offer and how we provide them to you. Your personal information and responses will remain strictly confidential (except where required by law), even if a third party conducts the survey. Participation in our customer surveys is voluntary. 

2\. We take the information we receive from individuals responding to our Customer Surveys and aggregate it with the responses from other customers to create broader, generic responses to the survey questions (such as gender, age, residence, hobbies, education, employment, industry sector, or other demographic information). We then use the aggregated information to improve the quality of our services to you, and to develop new services and products. This aggregated, non-personally-identifying information may be shared with third parties. 

#### F. ""Cookies"" and How We Use Them

A ""cookie"" is a small data file that can be placed on your hard drive when you visit certain websites. We may use cookies to collect, store, and sometimes track information for statistical purposes to improve the products and services we provide and to manage our telecommunications networks. If you are a Member, we will use a cookie to save your settings (which saves you time) and to provide customizable and personalized services. These cookies do not enable third parties to access any of your customer information. Advertisers and partners may also use their own cookies. We do not control the use of these cookies and expressly disclaim responsibility for information collected through them. We may also provide certain widgets or tools on our sites, such as tools that allow web surfers to easily share information on another platform, such as a social media platform. At other times, information from a third party may be embedded on our site, such as a map or information streaming from another site, including communications streaming from a third party social media platform. These widgets, tools, and informational items often function through the use of third party cookies utilized by the third party site, such as the social media platform. You may wish to review information at third party sites, such as social media platforms where you have an account, to determine how these third parties treat data that they obtain through the use of cookies. 

#### G. Additional Technologies

We may also use additional technologies such as pixel tags, web beacons, tracers, tracking scripts, clear GIFs and other technologies, and may permit our third party service providers to use these technologies. We use these technologies for purposes such as measuring the effectiveness of our advertisements or other communications, determining viewing and response rates, and determining which offers to present to you on our own or on third party sites. 

#### H. In the Event of a Change in Ownership

1\. As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy websites, subsidiaries, or business units. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise). 

2\. In the event of a change in ownership, or a merger or an acquisition, all (or select aspects) of our customer information may be transferred. All of our subscribers and registered users will be notified of any change in ownership, merger or an acquisition of our assets by a third party. Subscribers and users may choose to access and modify any of their registration and subscription information at that time. 

#### I. Special Cases

It is our policy not to use or share personal information about Visitors or Members in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses. However, we may disclose personal information about Visitors or Members, or information regarding your use of the Services or Web sites accessible through our Services, for any reason if, in our sole discretion, we believe that it is reasonable to do so, including: to satisfy laws, such as the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, regulations, or governmental or legal requests for such information; to disclose information that is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our Terms of Use or other policies; to operate the Services properly; or to protect us and our Members. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. 

#### J. Children’s Privacy

1\. We encourage parents and guardians to spend time online with their children. We urge parents to instruct their children never to give out their real names, addresses, or phone numbers without the permission of a parent or guardian, when using the Internet. We recognize a special obligation to protect personally identifiable information obtained from children, as may be collected on the Website. We fully comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”), which requires us take special precautions when collecting personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. 

2\. In compliance with COPPA, we have adopted the following policies to keep children safe. 

a. Personally identifiable information we collect from children under the age of 13 will be used solely by us or our agents for internal purposes only and will not be sold or otherwise distributed to third parties. 

b. We will not knowingly allow children under the age of 13 to access any social media site that may exist on the Website, email accounts, or other services we provide that would allow them to publicly post or otherwise distribute personally identifiable information. 

c. We will not knowingly ask a child under the age of 13 to divulge more information than is needed to participate in any activity, game, or service. 

d. We will not knowingly keep any personally identifiable information that is inadvertently included in a child's email submission, help inquiry, or other one-time request, if we know that the child is under the age of 13. Information will be automatically purged or purged immediately after the issue has been resolved. 

e. We will not knowingly post any personally identifiable information that is inadvertently included in a child's submission to a general audience contribution area if we know that the child is under the age of 13. These submissions will be deleted and handled anonymously thereafter. 

f. We will not knowingly provide any direct link to websites that are unsuitable for children or teens. 

g. Upon request, we will provide a parent or guardian with a description of the information that may have been provided about their child during a registration process for a program, service or contest on the Website. 

3\. Consistent with COPPA, there are few instances where we will collect information from children, such as: 

a. Requesting the contact information of a parent or guardian for the sole purpose of providing notification to the parent or guardian; 

b. Collecting children’s contact information on a one-time basis, such as when they enter a contest or ask us a question using the “contact us” link on our Website. We will use this information on a one-time basis solely to directly respond to the child’s request. 

c. Collecting a child's contact information and the contact information of his/her parent or guardian solely to directly respond more than once to a specific request from the child (for example, to satisfy the request for a newsletter subscription). The parent or guardian will have an opportunity at any time to revoke the child's request (i.e., unsubscribe). We will not use the child's personal information to re-contact the child for any other purpose; and 

d. Using cookies to collect non-personally-identifiable information on our Website for analytics and internal operations purposes. 

#### K. Your California Privacy Rights

California’s “Shine the Light” law permits California residents to annually request and obtain information free of charge about what personal information is disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year. 

* * *

### II. Credit Card Information

#### A. Credit Card Information

We are committed to handling your customer information with high standards of information security. Your credit card information is stored only in encrypted form and processed using a secured order server with Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology through use of a third party payment processor. We restrict access to your personally identifiable information only to employees or agents who need to know that information in order to provide products or services to you. While we make every effort to ensure the integrity and security of our network and systems, and those of our affiliates and agents, but we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent third-party ""hackers"" from illegally obtaining this information. 

If you to prefer to place your order by telephone, you can call us during normal business hours at 619-858-2200 with your credit card and billing information. 

#### B. What is your Credit Card Fraud Policy?

In the unlikely event that you experience unauthorized use of your credit card, promptly report the fraudulent activity to your credit card company. Under the Fair Credit Billing Act, your liability may be limited for fraudulent charges. Please check with your credit card company to verify specific terms and conditions. 

* * *

### III. Communication to Members and Visitors

We use personal information to communicate important information with our Members. Important information includes, but not limited to, student newsletters, instructor newsletters, lesson reminders, lesson journal entries, payment information, credit card update notifications, account status, legal updates, and other important account information. Members and, where applicable Visitors, agree to accept this communication from us. 

#### A. Online Advertisements

We occasionally display online advertisements on our Website and in our newsletters and alerts. We share aggregated and non-identifying information about our Visitors and Members collected through the registration process as well as through online surveys and promotions with these advertisers. Additionally, in some instances, we use this aggregated and non-identifying information to deliver tailored advertisements. For instance, an advertiser might tell us the audience they want to reach (for example, males between 25 and 55 years of age) and provide us with an advertisement tailored to that audience. Based upon the aggregated and non-identifying information we have collected, we may then display the advertisement to the intended audience. However, we do not share personal information about its Visitors or Members with these advertisers to be used for other purposes. 

#### B. Responses to Email Inquiries

When Visitors or Members send email inquiries to us, we use the return email address to answer the email inquiry we receive. We do not use the return email address for any other purpose and do not share the return email address with any third party. 

#### C. Our Commitment to Data Security

Services and websites we sponsor have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. While we make every effort to ensure the integrity and security of our network and systems, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent third-party ""hackers"" from illegally obtaining this information.

To the extent that you provide personally identifiable information to websites that link to or from our Website, different rules may apply to the use and disclosure of your personally identifiable information. To the extent that the Website includes third-party advertisements, the privacy policy of the advertiser providing the advertisement will govern the use of your personally identifiable information collected during your access to the advertisement. We do not control linking practices of advertisers or sponsors and do not monitor or claim responsibility for any content or privacy practices of such websites. Once you have left our Website, you must read the privacy policy of the advertiser or sponsor to see how your personally identifiable information will be handled. 

5\. On occasion, we may use an advertising server developed by a third party to display ads on our Website. Some of these ads may contain cookies that are set by third parties (advertisers, sponsors). We do not have access to these cookies or any information that they contain. This Privacy Policy does not cover any use of information that a third-party ad server may have collected from you. 

6\. We may use the Website as an entry into other networked web pages and websites operated by us and our subsidiaries and affiliates (together, the ""Transaction Sites”), such as for credit card processing. Please note that individual Transaction Sites may adopt privacy terms particular to the purpose of such Transaction Site or the transaction(s) taking place on such Transaction Site. As Transaction Sites are generally affiliated with commercial transactions that you or your business may have with us, particularly those which are password-protected or are subject to subscriptions, the privacy terms for such sites may differ through terms in separate agreements which may supplement or supersede these terms. 

1\. Registration may be allowed or required on the Website. Members are asked to provide certain personal information when they sign up for our Services including name, address, telephone number, email address and billing information (such as a credit card number and expiration date). The personal information collected from Members during the registration process is used to manage each Member's account (such as for billing purposes) and may be shared with other Members to coordinate Services. This information is not normally shared with unaffiliated third parties, unless specifically stated otherwise or in special circumstances. 

2\. We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. They have access to personal information gathered through the Services needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. 

3\. We may promote the Website, Services or a new service to members. You may manage your communication preferences within your account. 

4\. We may also generate non-identifying and aggregate profiles from personal information Members provide during registration (such as the total number, but not the names, of Members). As explained in more detail below, we may use this aggregated and non-identifying information to sell advertisements that appear on the Services. 

5\. While we make reasonable effort to prevent third party, non-affiliate access to personally identifiable information, you should keep in mind that data transmission over the Internet is not 100% secure and any information disclosed online can potentially be collected and used other than by the intended recipient. In view of the foregoing, we cannot warrant that your personally identifiable information will not be disclosed to or accessed by parties other than those authorized under this Privacy Policy. 

We may send, on behalf of third parties, promotions via mail or email to some or all of our Members. However, in no event do we sell or otherwise transfer to third parties the email addresses of our subscribers. We strictly maintain the confidentiality of our subscribers' email addresses, except as stated in this Privacy Policy. In addition, users are always given the opportunity of opting-out of these promotions. 

1\. We may periodically conduct both business and individual customer surveys. We encourage our customers to participate in these surveys because they provide us with important information that helps us to improve the types of services we offer and how we provide them to you. Your personal information and responses will remain strictly confidential (except where required by law), even if a third party conducts the survey. Participation in our customer surveys is voluntary. 

2\. We take the information we receive from individuals responding to our Customer Surveys and aggregate it with the responses from other customers to create broader, generic responses to the survey questions (such as gender, age, residence, hobbies, education, employment, industry sector, or other demographic information). We then use the aggregated information to improve the quality of our services to you, and to develop new services and products. This aggregated, non-personally-identifying information may be shared with third parties. 

A ""cookie"" is a small data file that can be placed on your hard drive when you visit certain websites. We may use cookies to collect, store, and sometimes track information for statistical purposes to improve the products and services we provide and to manage our telecommunications networks. If you are a Member, we will use a cookie to save your settings (which saves you time) and to provide customizable and personalized services. These cookies do not enable third parties to access any of your customer information. Advertisers and partners may also use their own cookies. We do not control the use of these cookies and expressly disclaim responsibility for information collected through them. We may also provide certain widgets or tools on our sites, such as tools that allow web surfers to easily share information on another platform, such as a social media platform. At other times, information from a third party may be embedded on our site, such as a map or information streaming from another site, including communications streaming from a third party social media platform. These widgets, tools, and informational items often function through the use of third party cookies utilized by the third party site, such as the social media platform. You may wish to review information at third party sites, such as social media platforms where you have an account, to determine how these third parties treat data that they obtain through the use of cookies. 

We may also use additional technologies such as pixel tags, web beacons, tracers, tracking scripts, clear GIFs and other technologies, and may permit our third party service providers to use these technologies. We use these technologies for purposes such as measuring the effectiveness of our advertisements or other communications, determining viewing and response rates, and determining which offers to present to you on our own or on third party sites. 

1\. As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy websites, subsidiaries, or business units. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise). 

2\. In the event of a change in ownership, or a merger or an acquisition, all (or select aspects) of our customer information may be transferred. All of our subscribers and registered users will be notified of any change in ownership, merger or an acquisition of our assets by a third party. Subscribers and users may choose to access and modify any of their registration and subscription information at that time. 

While using our Service and/or website, you will have opportunities to post reviews or other personal information in public areas. Please understand that when you post such information, it is made public and is not subject to this policy. We are not responsible for any third party’s use of personal information you publicly disclose through our Service. 

It is our policy not to use or share personal information about Visitors or Members in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses. However, we may disclose personal information about Visitors or Members, or information regarding your use of the Services or Web sites accessible through our Services, for any reason if, in our sole discretion, we believe that it is reasonable to do so, including: to satisfy laws, such as the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, regulations, or governmental or legal requests for such information; to disclose information that is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our Terms of Use or other policies; to operate the Services properly; or to protect us and our Members. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. 

1\. We encourage parents and guardians to spend time online with their children. We urge parents to instruct their children never to give out their real names, addresses, or phone numbers without the permission of a parent or guardian, when using the Internet. We recognize a special obligation to protect personally identifiable information obtained from children, as may be collected on the Website. We fully comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”), which requires us take special precautions when collecting personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. 

2\. In compliance with COPPA, we have adopted the following policies to keep children safe. 

a. Personally identifiable information we collect from children under the age of 13 will be used solely by us or our agents for internal purposes only and will not be sold or otherwise distributed to third parties. 

b. We will not knowingly allow children under the age of 13 to access any social media site that may exist on the Website, email accounts, or other services we provide that would allow them to publicly post or otherwise distribute personally identifiable information. 

c. We will not knowingly ask a child under the age of 13 to divulge more information than is needed to participate in any activity, game, or service. 

d. We will not knowingly keep any personally identifiable information that is inadvertently included in a child's email submission, help inquiry, or other one-time request, if we know that the child is under the age of 13. Information will be automatically purged or purged immediately after the issue has been resolved. 

e. We will not knowingly post any personally identifiable information that is inadvertently included in a child's submission to a general audience contribution area if we know that the child is under the age of 13. These submissions will be deleted and handled anonymously thereafter. 

f. We will not knowingly provide any direct link to websites that are unsuitable for children or teens. 

g. Upon request, we will provide a parent or guardian with a description of the information that may have been provided about their child during a registration process for a program, service or contest on the Website. 

3\. Consistent with COPPA, there are few instances where we will collect information from children, such as: 

a. Requesting the contact information of a parent or guardian for the sole purpose of providing notification to the parent or guardian; 

b. Collecting children’s contact information on a one-time basis, such as when they enter a contest or ask us a question using the “contact us” link on our Website. We will use this information on a one-time basis solely to directly respond to the child’s request. 

c. Collecting a child's contact information and the contact information of his/her parent or guardian solely to directly respond more than once to a specific request from the child (for example, to satisfy the request for a newsletter subscription). The parent or guardian will have an opportunity at any time to revoke the child's request (i.e., unsubscribe). We will not use the child's personal information to re-contact the child for any other purpose; and 

d. Using cookies to collect non-personally-identifiable information on our Website for analytics and internal operations purposes. 

California’s “Shine the Light” law permits California residents to annually request and obtain information free of charge about what personal information is disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year. 

When you attend live, group classes through TakeLessons or TakeLessons Live, other people who subscribe to TakeLessons will be able to see your name, your image, your comments, your voice, and your profile. In addition, we may also broadcast TakeLessons Live classes to other sites such as the TakeLessons Blog, YouTube or Facebook. In those instances, the general public may also be able to see your name, your image, your voice, and your comments (collectively referred to herein as the “Released Subject Matter”). By attending TakeLessons Live classes, you hereby freely and without restraint consent to and give unto TakeLessons and its agents or assigns (the “Releases”) the unrestrained right in perpetuity to own, utilize, or alter the Released Subject Matter, in any manner TakeLessons’ sees fit and for any purpose whatsoever, all of the foregoing to be without limitation of any kind. By participating in TakeLessons Live, you authorize the Releases and grant unto them the unrestrained rights to utilize the Released Subject Matter in connection with education, distribution, advertising, publicity, public displays, and exhibitions. You hereby stipulate that the Released Subject Matter is the property of the Releases to do with it as it will. You hereby waive to the fullest extent that you may lawfully do so, any causes of action in law or equity you may have or may hereafter acquire against the Releasees or any of them for libel, slander, invasion of privacy, defamation, copyright or trademark violation, right of publicity, or false light arising out of or in connection with the utilization by the Releasees or another of the Released Subject Matter. I release and indemnify the Releases from and against any claims arising from any breach of this warranty and the exercise of the rights granted herein. 

Your profile is fully visible to all Members, users and customers of our Services. It may also be visible to others on or off of our Services (e.g., users of third- party search engines). Excerpts from your profile may appear on the services of others (e.g., search engine results, mail and calendar applications that show a user a “mini” TakeLessons profile of the person they are meeting or messaging, social media aggregators). “Old” profile information may remain on these services until they update their data cache with changes you made to your profile. Your settings, the degree of connection or interests you have with the viewing Member, the subscriptions they may have, their usage, and other variables impact the availability of your profile and whether they can view certain fields in your profile. 

Our Services allow viewing and sharing information including through posts, likes, follows and comments. 

  * When you share an article or a post (e.g., an update, image, video or article) publicly it can be viewed by everyone and re-shared anywhere. Members, Visitors and others will be able to find and see your publicly-shared content, including your name (and photo if you have provided one). 

  * In a group, posts are visible to others in the group. Your membership in groups is public and part of your profile. 

  * When you follow a person or skill, you are visible to others as a follower. 

  * We let senders know when you act on their message. 

  * We let a Member know when you view their profile. 

  * When you like or re-share or comment on another’s content (including ads), others will be able to view these “social actions” and associate it with you (e.g., your name, profile and photo if you provided it). 




* * *

We are committed to handling your customer information with high standards of information security. Your credit card information is stored only in encrypted form and processed using a secured order server with Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology through use of a third party payment processor. We restrict access to your personally identifiable information only to employees or agents who need to know that information in order to provide products or services to you. While we make every effort to ensure the integrity and security of our network and systems, and those of our affiliates and agents, but we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent third-party ""hackers"" from illegally obtaining this information. 

If you to prefer to place your order by telephone, you can call us during normal business hours at 619-560-5693 with your credit card and billing information. 

In the unlikely event that you experience unauthorized use of your credit card, promptly report the fraudulent activity to your credit card company. Under the Fair Credit Billing Act, your liability may be limited for fraudulent charges. Please check with your credit card company to verify specific terms and conditions. 

* * *

We use personal information to communicate important information with our Members. Important information includes, but not limited to, student newsletters, instructor newsletters, lesson reminders, lesson journal entries, payment information, credit card update notifications, account status, legal updates, and other important account information. Members and, where applicable Visitors, agree to accept this communication from us. Please note that you cannot unsubscribe from certain correspondence from us, including messages relating to your account transactions. 

We occasionally display online advertisements on our Website and in our newsletters and alerts. We share aggregated and non-identifying information about our Visitors and Members collected through the registration process as well as through online surveys and promotions with these advertisers. Additionally, in some instances, we use this aggregated and non-identifying information to deliver tailored advertisements. For instance, an advertiser might tell us the audience they want to reach (for example, males between 25 and 55 years of age) and provide us with an advertisement tailored to that audience. Based upon the aggregated and non-identifying information we have collected, we may then display the advertisement to the intended audience. However, we do not share personal information about its Visitors or Members with these advertisers to be used for other purposes. 

When Visitors or Members send email inquiries to us, we use the return email address to answer the email inquiry we receive. We do not use the return email address for any other purpose and do not share the return email address with any third party. 

Services and websites we sponsor have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. While we make every effort to ensure the integrity and security of our network and systems, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent third-party ""hackers"" from illegally obtaining this information.

### Log Files

As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.

We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users' movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.

We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information.

### Cookies

A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this site. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.

We use both session ID cookies and/or persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's ""help"" file.

We set a persistent cookie to store your passwords, so you don't have to enter it more than once. Persistent cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site.

### Links to Other Sites

If you click on a link to a third-party site, (including on an advertisement), you will leave the Tarot.com site you are visiting and go to the site you selected.

We encourage you to review the privacy statements of any other service provider from whom you request services. If you visit a third-party website that is linked to a Tarot.com site, you should read that site's privacy statement before providing any personally identifiable information.

In order to provide you with a seamless experience, we may utilize a framing technique to make it appear that you are on our site; however, you may actually be on a third-party website.

  News and journalism are public activities. Your name, business contact details, and professional interests and affiliations may already be publicly available, particularly if you are a journalist, a recognized expert, or a PR professional.   We have created this privacy policy because we recognize that even in a business context you may have a need and expectation that your identity and interests be kept anonymous or private in certain circumstances. We want to be clear about when and how we protect that expectation.

You may visit a number of pages throughout the website without registration. We collect the information you, or the member company you represent, give us:

  
·         When you register. 

·         When a member company authorizes you to manage its account or use our web-based services on its behalf.

·         To provide information you request. 

·         To evaluate and improve our websites and services. 

·         To contact you directly about your use of an account or service for which you are registered.

Effective Date: February 2014

TracFone Wireless, Inc. (""TracFone"") has instituted a comprehensive set of privacy policies and procedures to ensure that its customers and website visitors' privacy is never compromised. The purpose of this privacy notice is to inform our customers and website visitors of the type of information that TracFone, or a credit card processing partner or other vendor acting on our behalf, collects, how the information is gathered, how it is utilized, how long it is retained and how customers and visitors can restrict its use or disclosure.

The primary focus of TracFone's privacy policy is to ensure that all customers and website visitors' personal information, which we term ""customer identifiable information,"" is kept private at all times. As the term suggests, ""customer identifiable information"" is information which can be associated with a specific individual or entity, including, for example, a customer's name, date of birth, address, telephone number, e-mail address and sensitive information such as credit card information.

The collection of customer identifiable information is a critical element in TracFone's day-to-day operations in order to conduct business and offer services and to maintain the highest level of customer service for all customers and website visitors.

TracFone endeavors to safeguard the customer identifiable information obtained from its website users and visitors (collectively, ""customers"") from any unauthorized intrusions.

General

We collect personal and non-personal information from customers based upon our business relationship and the nature of the products and services we provide. The types of information we may collect include account information (such as your name, address, home or alternate telephone number), certain financial information relating to any products and/or services that you purchase directly from us (including credit card information, security code and billing address), telephone numbers you call and that have called you and your service history, amongst other information. We also collect and maintain technical information about the equipment you use with our service including serial numbers, SIM card numbers, etc.

In some instances, TracFone may collect information that is not ""customer identifiable information."" Some examples of this type of information include the type of Internet browser you are using, the type of operating system you have configured on your computer, and the domain name of the website and/or Internet Service Provider from which you are linked to our website. TracFone primarily uses this information for market research and optimizing its systems in order to deliver the best customer experience possible.

TracFone may collect and use customer identifiable information for various purposes, including but not limited to, billing purposes such as the auto-refill program, to provide or change service, to anticipate and resolve problems with your service, or to inform you of products and services that better meet your needs. This means that TracFone may use your customer identifiable information in conjunction with information available from other sources, to market new services that may be of interest to you. When TracFone uses third parties to perform services on its behalf, such as marketing, fulfillment services and shipping to customers, TracFone will request that such third parties protect your customer identifiable information consistently with this privacy policy. TracFone will not, however, disclose your customer identifiable information to third parties who want to market products to you without your express, written or equivalent electronic consent. TracFone will not sell, trade, or disclose to third parties any customer identifiable information derived from the registration for, or use of, a TracFone product or service -- including customer names and addresses -- without the consent of the customer.

TracFone may, however, use and/or disclose customer identifiable information to a third party:

  * to investigate and help prevent potential fraud, other unlawful activity or activity that threatens the network;
  * as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process;
  * when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request;
  * to any other third party with your prior consent to do so;
  * if TracFone is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via a prominent notice on our Website of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.



We will retain your information only as long as needed for business, tax and/or legal purposes. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements. We will destroy your information once it is no longer needed.

Declining e-mail offers

TracFone will only send our customers e-mail regarding promotional offers or other news if a customer grants us permission to do so and provides an email address. A customer has the right to choose not to receive TracFone e-mail direct marketing communications by opting-out or unsubscribing. A customer can opt-out or unsubscribe from our e-mail list by clicking on the unsubscribe link found at the bottom of every message or promotion delivered electronically to our customers. Upon such election, TracFone (a) will not contact that customer directly with TracFone promotional messages, and (b) will not use customer identifiable information obtained from that customer's registration to contact that customer with TracFone product or service messages.

Security

TracFone has gone to great lengths to implement technology and security features to safeguard the privacy of your customer identifiable information from unauthorized access or improper use. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). TracFone, based on its judgment, will continue to enhance its security procedures as new technology becomes readily available. However, since there is no such thing as ""perfect Internet security,"" TracFone cannot guarantee 100% security. If you have any questions about security on our website, you can contact us at privacy@tracfone.com.

E-mail and Text Message Content

TracFone does not have access to private e-mail communications and text messages that are transmitted using TracFone services.

Cookies

When you visit our website, we may store information on your computer that allows us to identify you immediately. This process is often referred to as ""cookie"" technology. More specifically, a cookie is a commonly used Internet standard which stores, in a very small text file on the customer's hard disk, information specific to the customer. Our website makes limited use of cookies in an effort to improve our level of service to our website visitors. We may link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.

TracFone and its partners also use web beacons, widgets and server log files, in addition to cookies, to collect and or store demographic information about our user base as a whole. You can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level but if you choose to disable cookies, it may limit your use of certain features or functions on our website or service.

How information is used:

TracFone uses your information for various purposes, including but not limited to, billing purposes such as the auto-refill program, to provide or change service, to anticipate and resolve problems with your service, or to inform you of products and services that better meet your needs. This means that TracFone may use your information in conjunction with information available from other sources, to market new services that may be of interest to you. We also use your information for market research, and for optimizing our systems in order to deliver the best customer experience possible.

 We and our authorized advertising partners use cookies and other similar technologies to collect information to help tailor the ads you see on our sites and to help make decisions about ads you see on other sites. We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf. These companies employ cookies and action tags to measure advertising effectiveness. Any information that these third parties collect via cookies and action tags is completely anonymous. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by clicking here. To opt out of all IMM cookies click here. Please note that by ""opting out"" you will no longer receive targeted advertising. You will, however, continue to receive general advertising in the form of generic ads.

TracFone uses mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our Mobile Software on your phone. This software may record information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance data, and where the application was downloaded from. We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any personally identifiable information you submit within the mobile application.

Information Sharing

Your wireless number may be appended in the context of text messaging services operated by third party vendors. These vendors directly contact customers on behalf of TracFone, via text messages, with a series of marketing materials, reminders, etc. An opt-out mechanism is provided in these messages in compliance with applicable laws.

When TracFone uses third parties to perform services on its behalf, such as marketing, fulfillment services and shipping to customers, TracFone will request that such third parties protect your customer identifiable information consistently with this privacy policy. TracFone will not, however, disclose your customer identifiable information to third parties who want to market products to you without your express, written or equivalent electronic consent. TracFone will not sell, trade, or disclose to third parties any customer identifiable information derived from the registration for, or use of, a TracFone product or service -- including customer names and addresses -- without the consent of the customer.

TracFone may, however, use and/or disclose customer identifiable information to a third party:

  * to investigate and help prevent potential fraud, other unlawful activity or activity that threatens a service network;
  * as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process;
  * when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request;
  * to any other third party with your prior consent to do so;
  * if TracFone is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets.

You should be aware that any information you provide directly to Walmart will be subject to Walmart's Privacy Policy. This includes information you provide to Walmart in connection with your device purchase, upgrade, return, or replacement, whether in its stores, by phone or online, including but not limited to, if you purchase a Family Mobile device or obtain technical support for the device at or from Walmart or its agents. In addition, if you activate Family Mobile communications services at a Walmart store, Walmart may request personal information from you that is passed to TracFone as part of the activation process, but which may also be retained by Walmart. For information on Walmart's privacy policy and practices, see Walmart Privacy Policy.

TracFone also partners with other companies who supply software applications for use on our website.

How Customers and Visitors can restrict and protect information use:

Declining e-mail offers

TracFone will only send our customers e-mail regarding promotional offers or other news if a customer grants us permission to do so and provides an email address. A customer has the right to choose not to receive TracFone e-mail direct marketing communications by opting-out or unsubscribing. A customer can opt-out or unsubscribe from our e-mail list by clicking on the unsubscribe link found at the bottom of every message or promotion delivered electronically to our customers. Upon such election, TracFone (a) will not contact that customer directly with TracFone promotional messages, and (b) will not use customer identifiable information obtained from that customer's registration to contact that customer with TracFone product or service messages.

Security

TracFone has gone to great lengths to implement technology and security features to safeguard the privacy of your customer identifiable information from unauthorized access or improper use. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). TracFone, based on its judgment, will continue to enhance its security procedures as new technology becomes readily available. However, since there is no such thing as ""perfect Internet security,"" TracFone cannot guarantee 100% security. If you have any questions about security on our website, you can contact us at privacy@tracfone.com.

We also may use a standard feature found in browser software called a ""cookie"" to enhance your experience with the Site. Cookies are small files that your web browser places on your hard drive for record-keeping purposes. By showing how and when visitors use the Site, cookies help us deliver advertisements, identify how many unique users visit us, and track user trends and patterns. They also prevent you from having to re-enter your preferences on certain areas of the Site where you may have entered preference information before. This Site also may use web beacons (single-pixel graphic files also known as ""transparent GIFs"") to access cookies and to count users who visit the Site or open HTML-formatted email messages.

We also may provide your information to our affiliates or to third parties, including our third party service providers, contractors and advertisers, for purposes related to Site administration and operation. For example, if you use a credit or debit card to complete a transaction on our Site, we may share your personal information and credit card number with a credit card processing and/or a fulfillment company in order to complete your transaction, or such service provider(s) may collect that information from you directly, on our behalf.

We also reserve the right to use, and to disclose to third parties, all of the information collected from and about you while you are using the Site in any way and for any purpose, such as to enable us or a third party to provide you with information about products and services that may be of interest to you. In some cases we will use and/or share only non-personally identifiable information, but in other cases we may use and share personally identifiable information. If you do not wish your personally identifiable information to be used for these purposes, you must send a letter to the Online Privacy Coordinator whose address is listed at the end of this Privacy Policy requesting to be taken off any lists of personally identifiable information that may be used for these purposes or that may be given or sold to third parties.

### Data Collected in Connection with Ad Serving and Targeting

We may use cookies, web beacons and similar technologies, and/or a third-party ad serving software, to collect non-personally identifiable information about site users and site activity, and we may use this information to, among other things, serve targeted advertsements on this site. The information collected allows us to analyze how users use the site and to track user interests, trends and patterns, thus allowing us to deliver more relevant advertisements to users.

We also may use third-party service providers to target and serve some of the advertisements you see on the pages of our Site, and these providers likewise may use their own cookies, web beacons and similar technologies to collect non-personally identifable information from our Site. These service providers may use that information, sometimes in conjunction with similar non-personally identifable information gathered through other websites, to deliver advertisements on this Site, and on other websites that participate in our service providers’ advertising networks, that are tailored to match the perceived interests of consumers. This information also may be used to help measure and research an advertisement’s effectiveness, or for other purposes.

The data collected in connection with the ad serving and ad targeting on our Site does not identify you personally and does not include your name, address, email address or telephone number, but it may include the IP address of your computer.

The use and collection of information by third-party advertising service providers is governed by the relevant third party’s privacy policy and is not covered by our privacy policy. If you would like more information about the information collection practices of a particular service provider, or if you would like more information on how to opt out of a service provider’s information collection practices, please click here.

We cannot be responsible for any unauthorized third-party use of such information.

We may use cookies, web beacons and similar technologies, and/or a third-party ad serving software, to collect non-personally identifiable information about site users and site activity, and we may use this information to, among other things, serve targeted advertisements on this site. The information collected allows us to analyze how users use the site and to track user interests, trends and patterns, thus allowing us to deliver more relevant advertisements to users.

We also may use third-party service providers, including Yahoo!, to target and serve some of the advertisements you see on the pages of our Site. We may share non-personally identifiable information, such as type of pages viewed and categories of interest, from our Site with these service providers for their use in displaying ads on our Site.

These service providers may use that information, sometimes in conjunction with similar non-personally identifiable information gathered through other websites, to deliver advertisements on this Site, and on other websites that participate in our service providers’ advertising networks, that are tailored to match the perceived interests of consumers. In addition, Yahoo!, which is one of our third-party advertising service providers, may use information regarding its own users to select which ads to display on this Site. The non-personally identifiable information obtained by our third-party service providers also may be used to help measure and research an advertisement’s effectiveness, or for other purposes.

Users may email dataprotectionofficer@sdc.com to request data deletion, cancel their User account or fill out the GDPR User Rights form on the site.

Data Retention  
Information storage and security  
SDC.com uses data hosting service providers in the United States to host collected information, and we use technical measures to secure all data. Despite the thorough security measures and safeguards that SDC.com implements to protect data, no security system is impenetrable and due to the inherent nature of the Internet, SDC.com cannot guarantee that data, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our systems or otherwise in our care, is absolutely safe from intrusion by others. SDC.com has policies in place in case of such situation and will respond to requests about this within a reasonable timeframe.  Please contact dataprotectionofficer@sdc.com for more information.

How long we keep information  
How long we keep the information we collect about you depends on the type of information, as described in further detail below. After such time, we will make every effort to delete your information or, if this is not possible (for example, because the information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your information and isolate it from any further use until deletion is possible.  
User Account information: We retain User information until User delete their account(s), which then we will continue retaining the data for up to 90 days after account deletion. In particular: Email, Admin Notes, IPs, Access History, Payment History and Nickname. SDC.com maintains this practice due to the following reason:  
In the event that User’s account has been compromised and purposely deleted. SDC.com will help maintain and restore data once the situation is rectified.  
An account was mistakenly deleted by Users. In such an event, SDC.com will be able to restore data for Users.  
Various data storage systems and backups have different lifecycle policies which are held for a maximum of 90 days. For example, our database backups are encrypted, incremental and full re-cycle in 30 days. It is impossible to erase User data inside encrypted incremental backups in real-time.  
SDC.com may also retain some of the User data as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, to enforce our agreements, to support business operations and to continue to develop and improve our Services. Where we retain information for Service improvement and development, we take steps to eliminate information that directly identifies any specific Users, and we only use the information to uncover collective insights about the use of our Services, not to specifically analyze personal characteristics about any Users.   The information you share on the Services: If User’s account is deactivated or disabled, some of the User information and the content that Users have provided will remain in order to allow other members or other Users to make full use of the Services. For example, we continue to display comments and content you provided to forums. SDC.com will hold User data up to 90 days after account cancellation in case Users will renew again within that time frame.    
Marketing and Promotional information: If Users have elected and provided consent to receive marketing and promotional emails from SDC.com, we retain information about Users' marketing preferences unless asked specifically to delete such information. SDC.com retains information derived from cookies and other tracking technologies for a reasonable and specific period of time from the date such information was created.

Data Subject Access Request Procedure  
Data Subject Access Request (“DSAR”)  
A Data Subject Access Request (DSAR) is any request made by an individual or an individual’s legal representative for information held by the Company about that individual. The Data Subject Access Request provides the right for data subjects to see or view their own personal data as well as to request copies of the data.   
A Data Subject Access Request must be made in writing. In general, verbal requests for information held about an individual are not valid DSARs. In the event a formal Data Subject Access Request is made verbally to a staff member of the Company, further guidance should be sought from Data Protection Officer, who will consider and approve all Data Subject Access Request applications.   
A Data Subject Access Request can only be made via any of the following methods: email, post, or corporate website. DSARs made online must be treated like any other Data Subject Access Requests when they are received, though the Company will not provide personal information via social media channels.  
Requirements for a valid DSAR  
In order to be able to respond to the Data Subject Access Requests in a timely manner, the data subject should:  
• Submit his/her request using a Data Subject Access Request Form.  
• Provide SDC.com with sufficient information to validate his/her identity (to ensure that the person requesting the information is the data subject or his/her authorized person).  
Subject to the exemptions referred to in this document, SDC.com will provide information to data subjects whose requests are in writing (or by some other method explicitly permitted by the local law), and are received from an individual whose identity can be validated by SDC.com. Requests are more likely to be successful where they are specific and targeted at particular information.  
Factors that can assist in narrowing the scope of a search include identifying the likely holder of the information (e.g. by making reference to a specific department), the time period in which the information was generated or processed (the narrower the time frame, the more likely a request is to succeed) and being specific about the nature of the data sought (e.g. a copy of a particular form or email records from within a particular department).

Exemptions  
An individual does not have the right to access information recorded about someone else, unless they are an authorized representative, or have parental responsibility.   
SDC.com is not required to respond to requests for information unless it is provided with sufficient details to enable the location of the information to be identified, and to satisfy itself as to the identity of the data subject making the request.   
In principle, SDC.com will not normally disclose the following types of information in response to a Data Subject Access Request: • Information about other people – A Data Subject Access Request may cover information which relates to an individual or individuals other than the data subject. Access to such data will not be granted, unless the individuals involved have previously given consent to the disclosure of their data in one of the scenarios detailed above, such as communications from other users.  
• Repeat requests – Where a similar or identical request in relation to the same data subject has previously been complied with within a reasonable time period, and where there is no significant change in personal data held in relation to that data subject, any further request made within a three month period of the original request will be considered a repeat request, and SDC.com will not normally provide a further copy of the same data  
• Publicly available information – The Company is not required to provide copies of documents which are already in the public domain, such as stories, forum contributions, and other User generated content.  
• Opinions given in confidence or protected by copyright law – SDC.com does not have to disclose personal data held in relation to a data subject that is in the form of an opinion given in confidence or protected by copyright law.  
• Privileged documents – Any privileged information held by SDC.com need not be disclosed in response to a DSAR. In general, privileged information includes any document which is confidential (e.g. a direct communication between a client and his/her lawyer) and is created for the purpose of obtaining or giving legal advice.

Data Subject Access Request Refusals   
There are situations where individuals do not have a right to see information relating to them. For instance: • If the information is kept only for the purpose of statistics or research, and where the results of the statistical work or research are not made available in a form that identifies any of the individuals involved.  
• Requests made for other, non-data protection purposes can be rejected.  
If the responsible person refuses a Data Subject Access Request on behalf SDC.com, the reasons for the rejection must be clearly set out in writing. Any individual dissatisfied with the outcome of his/her Data Subject Access Request is entitled to make a request to the Data Protection Officer to review the outcome. 

No Guarantees for Factors Beyond SDC’s Control  
While this Privacy Statement expresses SDC's standards for maintenance of private data, it is not in a position to guarantee that the standards will always be met. There may be factors beyond SDC's control (e.g., ""script kiddies, crackers and other malcontents, hurricanes, tornados, acts of God, loss of power, diseases, loss of mind, body and soul"") that may result in disclosure of data. As a consequence, SDC disclaims any warranties or representations relating to maintenance or nondisclosure of private information.

Data Retention  
Information storage and security  
SDC.com uses data hosting service providers in the United States to host collected information, and we use technical measures to secure all data. Despite the thorough security measures and safeguards that SDC.com implements to protect data, no security system is impenetrable and due to the inherent nature of the Internet, SDC.com cannot guarantee that data, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our systems or otherwise in our care, is absolutely safe from intrusion by others. SDC.com has policies in place in case of such situation and will respond to requests about this within a reasonable timeframe. Please contact dataprotectionofficer@sdc.com for more information.

How long we keep information  
How long we keep the information we collect about you depends on the type of information, as described in further detail below. After such time, we will make every effort to delete your information or, if this is not possible (for example, because the information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your information and isolate it from any further use until deletion is possible.  
User Account information: We retain User information until User delete their account(s), which then we will continue retaining the data for up to 90 days after account deletion. In particular: Email, Admin Notes, IPs, Access History, Payment History and Nickname. SDC.com maintains this practice due to the following reason:  
In the event that User’s account has been compromised and purposely deleted. SDC.com will help maintain and restore data once the situation is rectified.  
An account was mistakenly deleted by Users. In such an event, SDC.com will be able to restore data for Users.  
Various data storage systems and backups have different lifecycle policies which are held for a maximum of 90 days. For example, our database backups are encrypted, incremental and full re-cycle in 30 days. It is impossible to erase User data inside encrypted incremental backups in real-time.  
SDC.com may also retain some of the User data as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, to enforce our agreements, to support business operations and to continue to develop and improve our Services. Where we retain information for Service improvement and development, we take steps to eliminate information that directly identifies any specific Users, and we only use the information to uncover collective insights about the use of our Services, not to specifically analyze personal characteristics about any Users. The information you share on the Services: If User’s account is deactivated or disabled, some of the User information and the content that Users have provided will remain in order to allow other members or other Users to make full use of the Services. For example, we continue to display comments and content you provided to forums. SDC.com will hold User data up to 90 days after account cancellation in case Users will renew again within that time frame.   
Marketing and Promotional information: If Users have elected and provided consent to receive marketing and promotional emails from SDC.com, we retain information about Users’ marketing preferences unless asked specifically to delete such information. SDC.com retains information derived from cookies and other tracking technologies for a reasonable and specific period of time from the date such information was created.

Data Subject Access Request Procedure  
Data Subject Access Request (“DSAR”)  
A Data Subject Access Request (DSAR) is any request made by an individual or an individual’s legal representative for information held by the Company about that individual. The Data Subject Access Request provides the right for data subjects to see or view their own personal data as well as to request copies of the data.   
A Data Subject Access Request must be made in writing. In general, verbal requests for information held about an individual are not valid DSARs. In the event a formal Data Subject Access Request is made verbally to a staff member of the Company, further guidance should be sought from Data Protection Officer, who will consider and approve all Data Subject Access Request applications.   
A Data Subject Access Request can only be made via any of the following methods: email, post, or corporate website. DSARs made online must be treated like any other Data Subject Access Requests when they are received, though the Company will not provide personal information via social media channels.  
Requirements for a valid DSAR  
In order to be able to respond to the Data Subject Access Requests in a timely manner, the data subject should:  
â€¢ Submit his/her request using a Data Subject Access Request Form.  
â€¢ Provide SDC.com with sufficient information to validate his/her identity (to ensure that the person requesting the information is the data subject or his/her authorized person).  
Subject to the exemptions referred to in this document, SDC.com will provide information to data subjects whose requests are in writing (or by some other method explicitly permitted by the local law), and are received from an individual whose identity can be validated by SDC.com. Requests are more likely to be successful where they are specific and targeted at particular information.  
Factors that can assist in narrowing the scope of a search include identifying the likely holder of the information (e.g. by making reference to a specific department), the time period in which the information was generated or processed (the narrower the time frame, the more likely a request is to succeed) and being specific about the nature of the data sought (e.g. a copy of a particular form or email records from within a particular department).

Exemptions  
An individual does not have the right to access information recorded about someone else, unless they are an authorized representative, or have parental responsibility.   
SDC.com is not required to respond to requests for information unless it is provided with sufficient details to enable the location of the information to be identified, and to satisfy itself as to the identity of the data subject making the request.   
In principle, SDC.com will not normally disclose the following types of information in response to a Data Subject Access Request: â€¢ Information about other people – A Data Subject Access Request may cover information which relates to an individual or individuals other than the data subject. Access to such data will not be granted, unless the individuals involved have previously given consent to the disclosure of their data in one of the scenarios detailed above, such as communications from other users.  
â€¢ Repeat requests – Where a similar or identical request in relation to the same data subject has previously been complied with within a reasonable time period, and where there is no significant change in personal data held in relation to that data subject, any further request made within a three month period of the original request will be considered a repeat request, and SDC.com will not normally provide a further copy of the same data  
â€¢ Publicly available information – The Company is not required to provide copies of documents which are already in the public domain, such as stories, forum contributions, and other User generated content.  
â€¢ Opinions given in confidence or protected by copyright law – SDC.com does not have to disclose personal data held in relation to a data subject that is in the form of an opinion given in confidence or protected by copyright law.  
â€¢ Privileged documents – Any privileged information held by SDC.com need not be disclosed in response to a DSAR. In general, privileged information includes any document which is confidential (e.g. a direct communication between a client and his/her lawyer) and is created for the purpose of obtaining or giving legal advice.

Data Subject Access Request Refusals   
There are situations where individuals do not have a right to see information relating to them. For instance: â€¢ If the information is kept only for the purpose of statistics or research, and where the results of the statistical work or research are not made available in a form that identifies any of the individuals involved.  
â€¢ Requests made for other, non-data protection purposes can be rejected.  
If the responsible person refuses a Data Subject Access Request on behalf SDC.com, the reasons for the rejection must be clearly set out in writing. Any individual dissatisfied with the outcome of his/her Data Subject Access Request is entitled to make a request to the Data Protection Officer to review the outcome. 

No Guarantees for Factors Beyond SDC’s Control  
While this Privacy Statement expresses SDC’s standards for maintenance of private data, it is not in a position to guarantee that the standards will always be met. There may be factors beyond SDC’s control (e.g., “script kiddies, crackers and other malcontents, hurricanes, tornados, acts of God, loss of power, diseases, loss of mind, body and soul”) that may result in disclosure of data. As a consequence, SDC disclaims any warranties or representations relating to maintenance or nondisclosure of private information.

Your right to privacy is very important to RTM Productions, Inc. (“RTM”). We are committed to helping you maintain control over your personal data while fostering the growth of a more interactive, engaging, and personalized web and wireless experience. RTM respects your right to control how much information you provide about yourself. The following Privacy Policy (this “Policy”) describes how RTM collects, protects, and uses information we receive from visitors to our web sites, including PowerBlocktv.com (the “Site(s)”), and from users of our wireless services via cellphones or other wireless devices (the “Service(s)”). By using one of our Sites or Services, you agree to the terms of this Policy. This Policy applies only to information collected through our Sites and Services and not to information collected offline.

Last Updated: August 26, 2010

What Personally Identifiable Information Is Collected

By “personally identifiable information,” we mean data that is unique to an individual, such as a name, address, or telephone number. We do not collect personally identifiable information on our Sites or through our Services unless you voluntarily provide information about yourself (a) by setting up an account on one of our Sites or for our Services, (b) via an electronic mail or text message, (c) by filling out one of our online forms, or (d) by purchasing an RTM product from one of our online stores.

No software or hardware techniques are employed to capture a visitor's email address or other personally identifiable information. RTM does not monitor individual traffic patterns on our Sites. RTM and our hosting company may use cookies to collect anonymous, aggregate information or statistics related to Site usage. These statistics indicate the total number of hits, the total number of page hits, the number of kilobytes transferred from our Sites, and the IP address of the visitor. If we decide to use this information to analyze Web traffic in the future, we will only be able to measure the number of visitors to our Sites and the addresses of the web sites from which our visitors come. Email addresses and other personally identifiable information are not available to us unless you affirmatively supply such information.

Because providing detailed information regarding this Policy when you register or provide information in connection with our Services often proves impractical, you may instead be provided with a short notice that reminds you to refer to this Policy and other relevant information from RTM. 

How the Information You Provide Is Used

Should you send us your comments or questions via email to any email address provided on one of our Sites or Services, we will only share your communications with our employees or agents most capable of addressing your questions and concerns. We will retain your communication until we have done our very best to provide you with a complete and satisfactory response and then we will either discard it or, in some cases, archive it. 

RTM may conduct contests, sweepstakes, and surveys through our Sites and Services. Some of these promotions may be conducted by RTM on behalf of an advertising or promotional partner. Any personally identifiable information that RTM collects from you as part of the promotion will be used by RTM to administer the promotion. For promotions that RTM conducts on behalf of an advertising or promotional partner through the Sites, RTM may share your personally identifiable information with that partner.

We share your personally identifiable information with our agents, representatives, contractors and service providers so they can provide us with support services such as authorization of credit card transactions, order processing, and sweepstakes fulfillment. 

From time to time, our advertising and promotional partners may desire to call your attention to promotions and offers they believe might interest you. If you prefer not to receive direct communications sent by our advertisers or promotional partners, you will be given an opportunity by the advertiser or promotional partner to opt-out of receiving such communications. If you opt-out, you will not receive further email or other communications sent directly by the advertiser or promotional partner, though we may on occasion send you information on their behalf. In all cases, however, we will use your information only as permitted by law.

From time to time, we may rent our list of customer names collected on our Sites to carefully selected merchandisers or advertisers, but you may choose to opt-out of such rentals by contacting us at info@powerblocktelevision.com or at the address provided below.

Except as described in this Policy, we will not disclose personally identifiable information unless we are required to do so by law or we in good faith believe that such action is necessary to: (a) comply with the law or with legal process; (b) protect and defend our rights and property; (c) protect against misuse or unauthorized use of any of our Sites or Services; or (d) protect the personal safety or property of our users or the public. 

Opt-Out

If you prefer not to receive emails from us, you will be given an opportunity to opt-out of receiving such communications in each email that you receive from us. Simply follow the removal instructions located at the bottom of the email message. If you opt-out, you will not receive further email communications from us. If you prefer not to receive communications from us by text message sent to your cellphone or other wireless device, you will be given an opportunity to opt-out of receiving such communications in each text message that you receive from us. If you opt-out, you will not receive further text message communications sent by us. 

You also can contact us at info@powerblocktelevision.com, or at the address provided below, indicating that you no longer want to receive email communications relating to one of our Sites or text messages relating to one of our Services. 

Security of Information Sent to Us

Please note that, unless we expressly advise you otherwise, the email functionality on our Sites does not provide a means for completely secure and private communications between us. Like all unencrypted Internet email communications, your email may be accessed and viewed by other Internet users, without your knowledge and permission, while in transit to us. For that reason, to protect your privacy, please do not use email to communicate information to us that you consider to be confidential. While we strive to protect your personal information, RTM cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we will use our commercially reasonable efforts to ensure its security on our internal systems. Depending on the nature of the inquiry, your communication may be discarded or archived. If you wish, you may instead contact us via telephone at the number provided in this Policy.

Disclosure of Customer Information Through Business Transfers

As we continue to develop our business, we may buy, merge, or partner with other companies or businesses, and in so doing, acquire customer information. In such transactions, customer information may be among the transferred assets. Similarly, in the event that a portion or substantially all of RTM's assets are sold or transferred to a third party, the information you have voluntarily provided to us, including your email address, would likely be one of the transferred business assets.

Our Commitment to Children's Privacy

We recognize the importance of protecting the privacy of children. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of thirteen. Our Sites and Services are directed to adults at least eighteen years old, and when a user discloses personal information through one of our Sites or Services, the user is representing to us that he or she is an adult. If a child has provided us with personal information, we ask that a parent or guardian email us at info@powerblocktelevision.com, and we will promptly delete the child's information from our records.

Access and Correction

You have a right to know about the personal information that RTM has collected from you through our Sites or Services, including the right to correct, amend, or delete the information that RTM has on file if it is incorrect. You may also change the status of whether you wish to receive alerts, newsletters, and communications from RTM at any time. If at any time you wish to exercise these rights, feel free to contact us at info@powerblocktelevision.com or by phone.

Special Notification for California Residents 

Under the California Civil Code, residents of the State of California that have provided any personally identifiable information to RTM have the right to request a list of all third parties to which RTM has disclosed personally identifiable information during the preceding year for direct marketing purposes. Alternatively, the law provides that if RTM has a privacy policy that gives either an opt-in or opt-out choice for use of personally identifiable information by third parties (such as advertisers or affiliated companies) for marketing purposes, RTM may instead provide you with information on how to exercise your disclosure choice options. RTM qualifies for the alternative option and has adopted a policy of not disclosing the personal information of customers to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes if the customer has exercised an option that prevents that information from being disclosed to third parties for those purposes. RTM has established this Policy that provides you with details on how you may either opt-in or opt-out of the use of your personally identifiable information by third parties for direct marketing purposes. If you are a California resident and request information about how to exercise your third party disclosure choices, please send a request to info@powerblocktelevision.com with a preference on how our response to your request should be sent.

Modifications to This Privacy Policy

By using one of our Sites or Services, you signify your agreement to the terms of this Policy. If you do not agree with the terms of this Policy, please do not disclose any personal information through any of our Sites or Services. This Policy and the use of our Sites and Services are governed by Tennessee law. Any claim related to any of our Sites, Services, or this Policy must be brought solely and exclusively in a federal or state court in Nashville, Tennessee within one year after the claim arises, or you agree that such claim will forever be barred. Users of our Sites and Services consent to the jurisdiction and venue of such courts as the most convenient and appropriate for the resolution of disputes concerning this Policy and/or use of our Sites or Services.

Please bear in mind that we may change the content or design of any of our Sites or Services and, consequently, this Policy at any time in the future. Notice of any revisions to this Policy will be posted to this page and on the homepage of each of our Sites, so please revisit this page from time to time to ensure that you are aware of any changes to this Policy. 

RTM welcomes comments and questions about this Policy and about any of our Sites or Services.

Information Automatically Collected From You – We and our service providers may automatically collect certain technical information from your computer or mobile device over time and across different websites when you use the Online Services, such as your Internet Protocol address, your geographic location, your browser type, your operating system, the pages you view on the Online Services, the pages you view immediately before and after you access the Online Services, and the search terms you enter on the Online Services. This information allows us and our service providers to recognize you and personalize your experience if you return to the Online Services, to improve the Online Services and the services we provide, and to provide you with Targeted Advertisements. We and our service providers may collect this information using “cookies,” which are small text files that many websites save on your computer when you visit and access when you return, or similar technologies. We also collect this information by setting a unique anonymous identifier called User ID, set by Universal Google Analytics. User ID helps identify unique users across multiple devices and browsers. Clearing your cookies does not ensure that you will not be recognized as the same unique visitor even after you cleared them. Website visitors who do not want their data collected with Google Analytics in this way can install the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on.

### Online advertisements

Our third-party advertising partners may use cookies and similar technologies on the Online Services and on third-party websites on which our ads appear, which allow the advertising partners to track certain information about user behavior, such as ""click-stream data."" The information practices of these advertising partners are governed by their own privacy policies and are not governed by this Privacy Policy.

### Where is this information processed?

Information collected through the Online Services will be processed in and subject to the laws of the United States. In addition, we may transfer your information outside the United States to our affiliates and service providers located in other countries. By using the Online Services, you consent to such transfer to, and processing in, the United States and these other countries.

### How is your information secured?

We strive to maintain reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to safeguard the information collected through the Online Services. However, no information system can be 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information. Moreover, we are not responsible for the security of information you transmit to the Online Services over networks that we do not control, including the Internet and wireless networks. If you have concerns about the security of sensitive information, do not send it electronically.

### Your choices

If you do not want the Online Services to collect information through the use of cookies, you can set your web browser to reject cookies from the Online Services. Each browser is different, so you should check your browser’s “Help” menu to learn how to change your cookie preferences. If you reject or block cookies from the Online Services, however, the Online Services may not function as intended.

In addition to the records left on your computer by cookies, your browser and operating system contain other records of your web browsing and other actions (e.g., browser history). As with cookies, you can find information about how to clear these history trails in your browser’s ""Help"" menu.

We do not currently respond to web browser “do not track” signals. If we do so in the future, we will describe how we do so in this Privacy Policy. For more information about do not track, visit www.allaboutdnt.org.

If you wish to review the contact information we have on file for you, correct your contact information, or inform us how you wish your contact information to be used, please contact our staff using the contact information below.

If we make any revisions that materially change the ways in which we use or disclose the information previously collected from you through the Online Services, we will give you the opportunity to consent to such changes before applying them to that information.

## FULL PRIVACY POLICY

This Privacy Policy describes the ways in which Planned Parenthood uses, discloses, and collects information from or about you through the Online Services. By using the Online Services, you consent to the processing of your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy, now and as amended by us.

###  

### How do we use your information?

We and our affiliates may use the information we collect from or about you through the Online Services for a number of purposes, including, but not limited to:

  * providing you with products, services, or information you request;

  * processing any transactions you have authorized;

  * following up on services or information we provided to you;

  * contacting you about fundraising campaigns or advocacy efforts;

  * delivering advertisements targeted to your interests based on your previous activity on the Online Services (commonly referred to as “Targeted Advertisements”) as well as other marketing communications, promotional materials, or advertisements that may be of interest to you;

  * conducting research;

  * promoting Planned Parenthood’s services or illustrating the importance of reproductive health and rights;

  * processing an employment, internship, or volunteer application;

  * providing you with information about the Online Services or required notices;

  * allowing us to improve the Online Services and the services we provide, such as by better tailoring our content to our users’ needs and preferences;

  * generating and analyzing statistics about your use of the Online Services; and

  * detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, intellectual property infringement, violations of our Terms of Use, violations of law, or other misuse of the Online Services.




We also may combine or aggregate any of the information we collect through the Online Services or elsewhere for any of these purposes, including for the delivery of Targeted Advertisements.

To further demonstrate how we and our affiliates may use the information we collect from or about you through the Online Services, we provide the following examples:

  * If you make a donation via the Online Services, your information will be added to one or more of our supporter lists and databases, and you may be contacted about other Planned Parenthood activities, news, and/or fundraising campaigns.

  * If you join or opt-in to our activist network, you will receive informational updates and action alerts about reproductive health and rights issues. In addition, your information will be added to one or more of our supporter lists and databases, and you may be contacted about other Planned Parenthood activities, news, and/or fundraising campaigns.

  * If you view certain content on the Online Services, we or a service provider of ours may later display an advertisement related to that content on a different webpage that you visit through the Online Services or on another non-Planned Parenthood website that has a relationship with the service provider.

  * If you use our website to submit your resume or materials for a paid or volunteer position, your information will be stored in a centralized database and may be accessible to our separately incorporated affiliates, who may be seeking candidates for full-time, part-time, or volunteer positions.




###  

### Under what circumstances do we disclose your information?

We may disclose the information we collect from or about you through the Online Services:

  * to our affiliates;

  * to service providers who work on our behalf and who have agreed to keep the information confidential and use the information solely to carry out the services that they are performing for us, including, but not limited to, service providers who process credit card transactions, facilitate our fundraising activities and campaigns, and deliver Targeted Advertisements on our behalf;

  * to other organizations that work with us for the provision of co-branded communications about Planned Parenthood and those organizations’ products or services;

  * to other organizations with whom Planned Parenthood participates in exchanges of supporter or donor information (e.g., donor list rental) and the service providers that facilitate such exchanges;

  * as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena or other legal process, a court order, or government reporting obligations;

  * when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary (a) to protect our rights, the integrity of the Online Services, or your safety or the safety of others, or (b) to detect, prevent, or respond to fraud, intellectual property infringement, violations of our Terms of Use, violations of law, or other misuse of the Online Services; and

  * to service providers, advisors, and other third parties to the extent reasonably necessary to proceed with the negotiation or completion of a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of our assets.




<In addition, we may share de-identified information, such as reports on user demographics and traffic patterns, with third parties, including researchers.

The Online Services also may contain links to third-party websites and applications for your convenience and information. Planned Parenthood does not control those third-party websites and applications or their privacy practices, which may differ from ours, and we do not endorse or make any representations about those third-party websites and applications. You acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible for the collection and use of your information by third-party websites and applications that are not under our control, and such information is not governed by this Privacy Policy. Remember that we cannot protect your privacy once you leave the Online Services, so when you visit third-party websites and applications, we encourage you to review their privacy policies and be careful about the information you submit or share.

Website-Specific Terms

eSpectra: If you use the eSpectra website, you accept the terms of this Privacy Policy, which is made part of the eSpectra User Agreement. If you have not done so already, please review our eSpectra User Agreement, which contains provisions specific to the eSpectra service. This Privacy Policy is expressly incorporated into the eSpectra User Agreement.

Peer X-Press: Peer X-Press (“PXP”) is AIP Publishing’s manuscript submission and peer review system. If you have registered for a PXP account, you will be asked to provide Personal Information such as your name, ORCID ID, email address, institutional affiliation, and country of residence. The primary purpose of gathering this information is to allow us to link a name and contact information to a user ID. The Personal Information that you provide to us via the PXP site, regardless of which journal you register with, is maintained in the Peer X-Press database. A single account enables you to submit or review a manuscript for any AIP Publishing journal. It also allows for information to be shared by the editorial offices in order to facilitate efficient transfers of manuscripts. Member Society PXP account information, however, is maintained in separate databases and is not shared outside of the individual society. If you are invited to review a manuscript, please be aware that although a reviewer's identity is never revealed to the author of the work itself, the report you provide, as well as your Personal Information, will be known to the editor and staff of any journal that considers the manuscript for publication. The same will hold true for an account that is created on your behalf when you are listed as a co-author for a manuscript submitted to an AIP Publishing or Member Society journal.

Other Sites: By using the Sites (other than eSpectra or PXP), you accept the terms of this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use. If you have not done so already, please review our Terms of Use, which contain provisions that limit our liability to you. This Privacy Policy is expressly incorporated into our Terms of Use. Any specific privacy considerations in addition to this general policy will be noted where applicable.

For example, if you have registered with one of the Affiliated or Member Societies of the American Institute of Physics, and access to our Sites is part of that registration, we will receive your Personal Information from that Member Society to set up your account and provide you with access. If you are provided with a subscription to our Sites through your employer or organization, we may collect your Personal Information to set up your subscription. In addition, we may collect your Personal Information from other individuals when, for example, an author suggests you as a reviewer for his or her paper or invites you to register for one of our Sites. In these cases, we will send you an email to notify you that you have been suggested as a reviewer and/or instructions for how to register for our Sites.

We may provide an opportunity for you to share information with third-party social media services, such as by associating your social media account with our Sites. When you do so, these social media sites may give us access to certain Personal Information that they store. When you associate your social media account with our Sites, you agree that we may collect, use and store the information provided by that social media service as described in this Privacy Policy. When you visit our branded-social media pages, such as, on Twitter, LinkedIn and Facebook, we may collect the Personal Information you provide on those pages and treat that information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

When you visit one of our Sites, Personal Information is automatically collected. For example, we use Google Analytics, which is a form of web measurement technology, to automatically track your interaction with our Sites and obtain insight into our website traffic and the effectiveness of our marketing. The types of Personal Information collected automatically may include but are not limited to your internet domain and IP address, the URL address of the previous website you visited, the URL addresses of the webpages that you visited on our Sites, your browser and operating system type, whether you completed certain tasks or were successful in your online requests while on the Sites, or the date and time of your visit.

We may store and share this Personal Information among one or more of our internal databases and create an archival copy for recordkeeping and internal purposes. We also may enhance the data we collect with other information from third-party sources.

The purpose in collecting Personal Information 

We primarily use the Personal Information we collect in an effort to improve your experience on the Sites, to provide you with services and Content, and to communicate with you about information that you request. We may also use your Personal Information to help us do the following:

  * To operate, improve and personalize the products and services we offer, and provide you with a more consistent and personalized experience when interacting with us.
  * To enable customer service, security, enforce our Terms of Service, and to detect fraud or illegal activities.
  * To create account efficiencies, such as a single customer record, and to eliminate redundancies and duplication.
  * To communicate with you, such as to relay important administrative and transactional announcements about the Sites or your account.
  * To conduct surveys and questionnaires about our Sites and the services we offer.
  * To improve the overall efficiency, security, and functionality of the site to make your visit more productive.
  * To provide you with editorial, marketing, and advertising that we think are relevant to your areas of interest, including materials from our third-party business partners.
  * To conduct research and analysis.
  * To analyze and report on website usage.



How Personal Information is shared

We may share your Personal Information for the reason(s) disclosed to you at the time that we collect your Personal Information and in the following ways:

  * At your direction: We will share your Personal Information with third parties when you tell us to. For example, if you fill out a form provided by one of our third-party sponsors or advertisers, we will provide that information to them for their own use.
  * With related entities: We may disclose Personal Information to the American Institute of Physics (AIP Publishing’s parent), Affiliated or Member Societies of the American Institute of Physics, and subsidiaries or related companies owned by AIP Publishing.
  * With our service providers: We share your information with our service providers that perform and offer services on our behalf. This allows us to enable specific services and functionality for which we have contracted or partnered, such as customizing our products or services, sending marketing and communications related to our business, payment processing, and improving our Sites. AIP Publishing is responsible for subsequent transfers to a third party acting as an agent on our behalf.
  * For legal purposes: We may disclose your Personal Information to government authorities or third parties, as needed within our reasonable judgment, to identify fraud, to protect and enforce our rights or the rights of our customers or related entities, in response to a subpoena, regulation or other legal process, and when required by law.
  * During corporate changes: We may transfer your Personal Information in the event of a merger, sale, acquisition or other change of ownership or control of our company (whether in whole or in part).



Cookies and other data collection technologies

AIP Publishing uses cookies, which are files that are placed on your computer when you first visit a webpage. Cookies allow you to move through the Site more smoothly and enhance your user experience by making it more seamless. They also allow us to record information when you revisit our Sites, retain your customized preferences, and deliver advertisements to you that are tailored to your interests.

AIP Publishing also uses the following types of data collection technologies:

  * Session cookies: Session cookies are designed so that once you close your browser, the cookie will simply terminate. They help you navigate the Site by acting like placeholders or bookmarks to temporarily store information. Session cookies assist you in performing functions such as filling your shopping cart.
  * Persistent cookies: Persistent cookies are permanent and remain on your computer after you terminate your session. Your ability to customize settings based on your own preferences is dependent on persistent cookies. Each time you return to our Site, for example, persistent cookies allow us to identify you as a returning user, so that you don’t have to re-enter information that you’ve already provided.
  * Third-party cookies: AIP Publishing uses third-party cookies to enable our trusted partners to bring increased functionality to our Site. For example, AIP Publishing has partnered with a service that allows for the collection of usage data for our own marketing purposes. The information we obtain may be used to offer you assistance, to help us make improvements to the website, or to send you special offers that relate to the content you’ve viewed.
  * Web beacons: Web beacons, or single pixel gifs, are a form of tracking technology that record user behavior. We use web beacons on our Site and in emails we may send to you to collect information such as whether you opened a web page or email, your IP address, the type of browser you used, etc. This information allows us to measure the effectiveness of our campaigns, to target specific content only to those who are most interested, and to improve our features and your overall user experience.
  * Do Not Track: Some web browsers incorporate a Do Not Track (“DNT”) or similar feature that signals to digital services that a user does not want to have his/her online activity tracked. If a digital service that responds to a particular DNT signal receives the DNT signal, the browser can block that digital service from collecting certain information about that browser’s user. Not all browsers offer a DNT option and DNT signals are not yet uniform. For this reason, we and many other digital service operators do not respond to DNT signals. For more information about DNT signals, visit http://allaboutdnt.com.  



Online advertising 

We may contract with third-party remarketing services, such as Google AdWords, to tailor advertising to our users. Through the use of cookies, Google Adwords tracks what parts of our Site you visited in order to serve you relevant ads on other websites you visit as you navigate across the Internet. This ensures you only receive content that is of interest to you. Please understand that if you disable cookies (as discussed below) to prevent such interest-based advertising, you may still see advertisements – they just will not be tailored to your interests.

Your online choices

You can control what types of cookies you wish to allow, delete, or disable through the settings in your browser. If you restrict cookies, however, you may not obtain the optimum benefit of the Sites’ functionality or be able to access all of its content.

  * If you would like to opt out of participating in Google AdWords Remarketing, please visit Google’s Ads Settings.
  * To prevent information from being collected by Google Analytics, you can install the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on.
  * To opt out of any third-party vendor's use of cookies, please visit networkadvertising.org/choices/.
  * More information about the nature of cookies and how they work may also be found at allaboutcookies.org.



Your access and opt-out rights

AIP Publishing strives to make sure that our information is reliable, accurate, and up-to-date. While Personal Information is maintained by AIP Publishing, you may access the Personal Information that we have collected directly from you to the extent required by law to review, update, and correct inaccuracies. You can also visit your account to manage and correct the Personal Information we have on file for you. Upon request made to the contact listed below under the section titled “Contact information,” we will provide You with reasonable access to the Personal Information we have collected from You. If you contact us directly we will take reasonable steps to confirm your identity before making any changes. Because Personal information—for example, your email address—is required to use the Site, we retain certain Personal Information as long as your account is active. You will have the opportunity to correct, transfer, update, modify, or delete this information by logging into Your account and updating Your Personal Information online. Please note that some information may remain in our records even after You request deletion of Your Personal Information, to the extent permitted by applicable laws. Additionally, there may be limits to the amount of information we can practically provide. For example, we may limit access to Personal Information where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to an individual's privacy or where doing so would violate others' rights. 

If you wish to opt-out of having your Personal Information used for advertising or marketing purposes, or to remove your information from any list that might be sold or given to another organization, please send a request to help@scitation.org. You may also unsubscribe from our marketing emails that you receive from us at any time by clicking the “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of the email or by sending your request to help@scitation.org. Please note that unsubscribing from marketing communications shall not limit our ability to send transactional communications to you regarding products or services you have requested.

How we protect your Personal Information

AIP Publishing takes reasonable and appropriate steps to protect and prevent unauthorized access to your Personal Information and to ensure the integrity of that information.

While AIP Publishing continually monitors the security status of its networks, it cannot guarantee that any transmission of data made over the Internet is totally secure. You have a responsibility as well to help protect the information you provide by keeping your account information confidential and not using unsecured or unencrypted networks.

Data integrity and purpose limitation

AIP Publishing limits the use of Personal Information to ways that are compatible and relevant for which the Personal Information was collected or subsequently authorized or for which consent was obtained. We will take reasonable steps to ensure that Personal Information is reliable for its intended use, accurate, complete, and current.

Records retention

AIP Publishing will retain Your Personal Information as needed to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected. AIP Publishing will retain and use Your Personal Information as necessary to comply with our business requirements, legal obligations, resolve disputes, protect our assets, and enforce our agreements.

The Sites may offer users the opportunity to submit, publish or share comments, reviews, and other content (“User Content”).

Links and third-party websites

AIP Publishing Sites contain links to other websites, and other websites link to our Sites. Please be aware that AIP Publishing is not responsible for the privacy practices of other third-party websites that we do not operate or control, and this Privacy Policy does not apply to the information collected by third parties through their websites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our Sites and to read the privacy statements of each of the website that you visit.

Non-U.S. residents

If you reside outside the United States, please be aware that any information you provide to us, including Personal Information, will be transferred to, collected, processed, and stored in the United States. Privacy and data protection laws differ from country to country, and the laws in the United States may offer less protection than the laws of your country. When you provide your information to us, you consent to the processing of your data in, and the transfer of your data to, the United States.

Notification of changes 

The Effective Date of this Privacy Policy is set forth at the top of this page. Whenever possible, we will provide you with advance notice of any material changes to this Privacy Policy. We will not make retroactive changes that reduce your privacy rights unless we are legally required to do so.

This Privacy Policy describes how AIP Publishing LLC (“AIP Publishing” or “we” or “us”) collects, uses, and discloses the information that we obtain through our Scitation website (www.scitation.org), eSpectra website (http://espectra.aip.org), Peer X-Press websites, and the other online sites owned or operated by AIP Publishing that also link to this policy (the “Sites”), as well as information that we obtain offline. Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to information collected through third-party websites or services that you access through the Sites.

Please review this Privacy Policy carefully. When you submit information to or through the Sites, you consent to the collection and processing of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. Unless otherwise stated here, this Privacy Policy is made part of our Terms of Use. We encourage you to review our Terms of Use, which contains important information about our liability to you when you use the Sites.

If you do not agree with any part of this Privacy Policy, the Terms of Use, or, in the case of eSpectra, the User Agreement, then please do not use our Sites. Any specific privacy considerations in addition to this general policy will be noted where applicable.

Website-specific terms

While the Privacy Policy describes AIP Publishing’s general privacy practices, the websites below have the following unique practices that diverge from the practices described elsewhere in the policy:

eSpectra: If you use the eSpectra website, you accept the terms of this Privacy Policy, which is made part of the eSpectra User Agreement. If you have not done so already, please review our eSpectra User Agreement, which contains provisions specific to the eSpectra service. This Privacy Policy is expressly incorporated into the eSpectra User Agreement.

Peer X-Press: Peer X-Press (“PXP”) is AIP Publishing’s manuscript submission and peer review system. If you have registered for a PXP account, you will be asked to provide Personal Information, such as your name, ORCID number, email address, institutional affiliation, and country of residence. The primary purpose of gathering this information is to allow us to link a name and contact information to a user ID.

The Personal Information that you provide to us via the PXP site, regardless of which journal you register with, is maintained in the Peer X-Press database. A single account enables you to submit or review a manuscript for any AIP Publishing journal. It also allows for information to be shared by the editorial offices to facilitate efficient transfers of manuscripts. Member Society PXP account information, however, is maintained in separate databases and is not shared outside of the individual society.

If you are invited to review a manuscript, please be aware that although a reviewer's identity is never revealed to the author of the work itself, the report you provide, as well as your Personal Information, will be known to the editor and staff of any journal that considers the manuscript for publication. The same will hold true for an account that is created on your behalf when you are listed as a co-author for a manuscript submitted to an AIP Publishing or Member Society journal.

PXP is an online manuscript submission and peer review system, not a general website. While our Privacy Policy describes our general practices regarding the Personal Information obtained through our other websites, the Personal Information obtained through the PXP site is not shared with third parties other than our service providers to facilitate the peer review process, and, as stated above, with journal editorial offices and staff when manuscripts are transferred. We also do not market to PXP users without their express consent.

Information we collect 

When you use our Sites, we collect Personal Information that helps us identify you as an individual, as well as Personal Information about your use of the Sites. The information that we collect and how we use it depends on how you use and access the Sites. We also collect Personal Information from you regarding the activities described on the Sites when you voluntarily send it to us outside of the Sites or offline. Such information shall be treated as Personal Information submitted through the Sites and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

Personal Information 

When you use our Sites, we collect Personal Information directly from you. “Personal Information” is any information that identifies an individual or relates to an identifiable individual, such as your name, mailing address, phone number, email address, or society membership details. We collect your Personal Information when you, for example, set up an account; register for a service, subscription, or alert; obtain access to certain content; sign up for a newsletter; submit a Comment or post on a blog or public message board; make a purchase; or send an inquiry to our customer service team.

We also collect your Personal Information from other organizations or individuals. For example, if you have registered with one of the Affiliated or Member Societies of the American Institute of Physics and access to our Sites is part of that registration, we will receive your Personal Information from that Member Society to set up your account and provide you with access. If you are provided with a subscription to our Sites through your employer or organization, we collect your Personal Information to set up your subscription. In addition, we collect your Personal Information from other individuals when, for example, an author suggests you as a reviewer for his or her paper or invites you to register for one of our Sites. In these cases, we will send you an email to notify you that you have been suggested as a reviewer and/or instructions for registering on our Sites.

We also provide an opportunity for you to share information with third-party social media services, such as by associating your social media account with our Sites. When you do so, these social media sites give us access to certain Personal Information that they store. When you associate your social media account with our Sites, you agree that we will collect, use, and store the information provided by that social media service as described in this Privacy Policy. When you visit our branded social media pages, such as on Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook, we collect the Personal Information you provide on those pages and treat that information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

When you visit our Sites, Personal Information is automatically collected. For example, we use Google Analytics, which is a form of web measurement technology, to automatically track your interaction with our Sites and obtain insight into our website traffic and the effectiveness of our marketing. The type of Personal Information collected automatically includes but is not limited to your Internet domain and IP address, the URL address of the previous website you visited, the URL addresses of the webpages that you visited on our Sites, your browser and operating system type, whether you completed certain tasks or were successful in your online requests while on the Sites, and the date and time of your visit.

We will store and share this Personal Information among one or more of our internal databases and create an archival copy for record keeping and internal purposes. We also may enhance the data we collect with other information from third-party sources.

The purpose in collecting Personal Information 

We primarily use the Personal Information we collect to improve your use of the Sites, to communicate with you about information that you request, and to help us do the following:

  * Operate the Sites effectively, deliver our products and services, and provide you with a more consistent and personalized experience when interacting with us.
  * Perform timely customer service and communicate important administrative and transactional announcements about the Sites or your account.
  * Create account efficiencies, such as a single customer record, and eliminate redundancies and duplication.
  * Enforce our Terms of Service and detect fraud or illegal activities.
  * Conduct surveys and questionnaires about our Sites and the services we offer.
  * Improve the overall security and functionality of the Sites to make your visit safer and more productive.
  * Provide you with editorial, marketing, and advertising information that we think is relevant to your areas of interest, including materials from our third-party business partners. We won’t share your Personal Information with these companies but will send you the information on their behalf.
  * Enable research and promote the innovation of our products and services.
  * Analyze and report on website usage.



How Personal Information is shared

We will share your Personal Information only for the reason(s) disclosed to you at the time that we collect it and in the following ways:

A list of related entities can be found at https://www.aip.org/member-societies.
  * With our service providers: We share your information with our service providers that perform and offer services on our behalf. This allows us to enable specific services and functionality for which we have contracted or partnered, such as customizing our products or services, sending marketing and communications related to our business, payment processing, and improving our Sites. AIP Publishing is responsible for subsequent transfers to a third party acting as an agent on our behalf.
  * For legal purposes: We will disclose your Personal Information to government authorities or third parties, as needed within our reasonable judgment, to identify fraud; to protect and enforce our rights or the rights of our customers or related entities; in response to a subpoena, regulation, or other legal process; and when required by law.
  * During corporate changes: We will transfer your Personal Information in the event of a merger, sale, acquisition, or other change of ownership or control of our company (whether in whole or in part).

Online advertising 

We contract with third-party remarketing services, such as Google AdWords, to tailor advertising to our users. Using cookies, these services track what parts of our Sites you visited in order to serve you relevant ads on other websites you visit as you navigate across the Internet. This ensures you receive only content that is of interest to you. Please understand that if you disable cookies (as discussed below) to prevent such interest-based advertising, you will still see advertisements – but they will not be tailored to your interests.

Your online choices

You can control what types of cookies you wish to allow, delete, or disable through the settings in your browser. If you restrict cookies, however, you will not obtain the optimum benefit of the Sites’ functionality or be able to access all of the content. In addition, we participate in behavior-based advertising. This means that a third party uses technology (e.g., a cookie) to collect information about your use of our website so that they can provide advertising about products and services tailored to your interests. That advertising appears on either our websites or other websites. You can opt out of receiving advertising based upon your browsing behavior from some of the network advertising companies that deploy cookies on some of our websites by going to the Network Advertising Initiative website at www.networkadvertising.org/choices/. You can also use the following links to opt-out of advertising based on the following tracking cookies:

  * If you would like to opt out of participating in Google AdWords Remarketing, please visit Google’s Ads Settings.
  * To prevent information from being collected by Google Analytics, you can install the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on.

s1now ltd is committed to protecting your right to personal privacy. That is why we have drafted this notice to explain the type of information we collect on this web site (the ""Site"") and how we use this information. This Policy also explains the choices that you can make about the way your information is collected and used.

By submitting personal details to us, you are deemed as agreeing to use of these details as described in this Policy. We appreciate that this Policy may seem long, however, we have created a thorough privacy statement to fully explain our information handling practices. Should you have any questions however, please feel free to direct these to servicedesk@s1jobs.com

The Information We Collect

We request very little identifying information from you and only for a narrow set of purposes. Typically, identifying information is collected:

  * For registration to certain areas of the Site;
  * To allow us to respond to your enquiries for further information;
  * To distribute requested materials;
  * When you are submitting CVs;
  * To allow recruiters to search your career profile.



The type of personal information collected on the Site could include your name, address, email address, telephone number, user name and password. However, other information will be submitted when you respond to an online job application or register to get head-hunted.

Your participation is voluntary and you will not be required to provide more information than is necessary to participate in any of the Site's activities. In any instance where non-mandatory information is sought, you will be notified of this at the point of collection.

In some instances, we may ask you questions on an aggregate basis (we don't identify you personally with the information) and such questions will be identified on the site. In all other instances, you should assume that we track any information you provide on a personally identifiable basis. 

The Way We Use Information

We may occasionally request your postcode details in order to ensure that we only deliver information relevant to you and only where we have obtained your prior express permission to do so. We will NOT use your postcode information to generate a full postal address (where completion of full address fields are not requested), nor will we mail out literature related to our websites unless you specifically request us to do so.

Users may provide their mobile phone numbers in order to receive relevant SMS text messages regarding services on our websites.

When you register with the Site, you can elect to receive information and updates on our products and services by email. We use return email addresses to answer any emails that we receive, and we may use return email addresses to send you other information that you may request. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose.

To complete your registration in the CV Database area of the Site to ‘Get Head Hunted’, your permission will be required to receive a bi-annual email from the Site which in turn requests you renew your candidate profile in the CV Database area.

We use information that you provide (individual and aggregate) to better design the Site and to improve our marketing strategy and our products. One method through which the Site collects aggregate information is the collection of IP addresses. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web. Web servers, the computers that ""serve up"" Web pages, automatically identify your computer by its IP address. When you request a page from this site, our servers log your IP address. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, so although your session will be logged, you will remain anonymous to us. To the extent such information is shared with third parties, please see ""Our Privacy Practices With Third Parties"" below.

You will have the opportunity to forward pages or information on the Site to friends. The information you provide to facilitate this email communication is used on a one-time basis and is not collected or retained by us.

We make every practical effort to avoid excessive or irrelevant collection of data. If you believe the Site has collected excessive information, we encourage you to contact us servicedesk@s1jobs.com

Our Privacy Practices with Third Parties

It is our policy to only disclose information to third parties under the following circumstances:

We share aggregate, non-personally identifiable information about our users with advertisers, business partners, sponsors, and other third parties.

Access by our employees and agents to your personally identifiable information are only on a need to know basis on the understanding that this is confidential business information.

Our intention is never to use or share personally identifiable information provided to us in ways that are different than the ways described above without also providing you with an opportunity to ""unsubscribe"" or prohibit such unrelated uses.

Links to Other Sites

These other sites may send their own cookies to users, or otherwise collect data or solicit personal information. We assume no responsibility for the information practices of sites that you are able to access through ours, and we encourage you to review each site's privacy policy before disclosing any personally identifiable information.

Our Commitment to Data Security

We take reasonable precautions to keep your personal information secure. We have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard the information we collect. We cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose online, and you do so at your own risk.

We share aggregate, non-personally identifiable information about our users with advertisers, business partners, sponsors, and other third parties.

OVERVIEW  
The Zoological Society of San Diego (ZSSD), operators of www.sandiegozoo.org, www.conservationandscience.org, and www.shopzoo.com, recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy of the users of these Web sites. Except when express permission is specifically and knowingly provided by you, the Web site user, the ZSSD collects no personally identifying information about individuals. The name, address, and payment information (if applicable) that the user might provide when using these Web sites may be processed or disclosed by the ZSSD as permitted under the Web site’s Terms of Use, which the user agrees to upon utilizing the information and services of www.sandiegozoo.org and/or www.shopzoo.com, and/or www.conservationandscience.org. It is necessary to gather certain information from you in order to provide an efficient and pleasant shopping experience. By using a number of security technologies in our Web sites, we maintain as a priority the privacy of your information. We also adhere to strict policies preventing the unauthorized use of your personal information. Information collected is for internal use only; WE DO NOT SELL OR COLLECT PERSONAL INFORMATION FOR THE USE OF OTHER PARTIES. Finally, please note that this policy applies only to www.sandiegozoo.org, www.shopzoo.com, and www.conservationandscience.org,and not to our sponsors’ or partners’ Web sites to which we link. 

INFORMATION COLLECTED  
Information we collect from you is used to help us monitor site usage and traffic patterns of our customers to the extent that it serves our legitimate business purposes. The ZSSD will maintain appropriate safeguards to ensure the security, integrity, and privacy of the information. Statistical aggregate information, as well as personal information, is collected for internal and administrative purposes. Any public disclosure of aggregate information regarding site usage and traffic, which is necessary for business marketing purposes, is always devoid of any personally identifying information. 

COOKIES  
In addition to information you submit, we may also utilize cookies, which are small pieces of information sent to your Web browser by a Web site that you visit. Used as a method of tracking, the use of www.sandiegozoo.org, www.shopzoo.com, and www.conservationandscience.org, to provide a safe, secure, and convenient shopping experience, cookies also enable the ZSSD to relate a visitor’s use of ZSSD information to any information that the visitor may have specifically and knowingly provided to the ZSSD. Any such voluntarily provided information, if applicable, may be used by the ZSSD for editorial, marketing, or promotional purposes. Such identifying information, if applicable, will not be transferred to any other party unless otherwise stated at the time of collection. 

CHILDREN AND PRIVACY  
The ZSSD is concerned about protecting children’s privacy. If you are 12 years of age or younger, we do not want your personal information. Please do not submit any personal information to us. There may be some areas within www.sandiegozoo.org, www.shopzoo.com, or www.conservationandscience.org, where people may post messages or provide feedback, but children are again discouraged from providing any personal information. If a visitor known to be a child (under the age of 13) sends an e-mail to the ZSSD, we will only use it to respond to the e-mail and not to create profiles or otherwise retain the information. 

SECURE SHOPPING  
The Zoological Society of San Diego has incorporated the latest Internet technological standards into the design of the secure purchase areas of www.sandiegozoo.org, www.shopzoo.com, and www.conservationandscience.org. We also monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to access, upload, or change information on the Web site and across the network. Under no uncertain terms, any information you send us while within the secure shipping area is protected by 128-bit “Secure Socket Layer” SSL encryption, making your transaction safe and reliable. You can tell whether you are in our secure shopping area by viewing the lock or key at the bottom of your browser—an unlocked or broken key (depending on your browser) means you are in an unsecured area. 

Shopping on the Internet is safe, and online credit card transactions are no more risky than other means of shopping. Our encryption methods make credit card fraud even more difficult than mail or phone orders, or even in-person purchases. If you experience fraudulent use of your credit card as a result of using our Web site, notify your credit card company per its rules and procedures. Most credit card companies will either cover the fraudulent purchases or hold you liable for no more than $50.

As a standard Internet practice, should your credit card company hold you liable for some portion of a fraudulent charge, www.sandiegozoo.org, www.shopzoo.com, or www.conservationandscience.org will reimburse you for the maximum liability of $50, provided the purchase was made through our secure server.

The ZSSD needs to know your name, e-mail address, shipping address, credit card number and expiration date in order to process and fulfill your order. We might also request additional information that you choose to submit about your interests or feedback about our site and products so that we can provide a better shopping experience for you. The name, address, and payment information that the user might provide when using www.sandiegozoo.org www.shopzoo.com, and www.conservationandscience.org may be processed or disclosed by the ZSSD as permitted under the Web site’s Terms of Use, of which the user agrees to upon utilizing the information and services of the Web sites.

YOUR CONSENT AND CHANGES TO POLICY  
By using www.sandiegozoo.org, www.shopzoo.com, or www.conservationandscience.org, you consent to this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use. This privacy policy may be changed at any time. Please check this page periodically for any changes. Your continued use of www.sandiegozoo.org, www.shopzoo.com, or www.conservationandscience.org following the posting of any changes constitutes your acceptance of the changes.

The Daily Beast Company LLC has prepared this Privacy Policy to help you understand more about how we collect, use, and disclose information that we collect about consumers through our web and mobile services, which we refer to in this Privacy Policy collectively as the “Services.”  


This Privacy Policy does not cover information that we collect about you outside of our normal consumer services. For example, it does not cover information that we collect in news reporting or as a part of our business arrangements. Also, this Privacy Policy does not cover information that you voluntarily make public, such as by posting it in a publicly accessible place on the Internet.

What information do you collect about me?  
The information that we collect about you falls into these general categories:  
• Information that you provide. We may collect information that you choose to provide to us (including in comments or other user content that you submit to us or when you subscribe to our newsletter(s)). This may include information such as your name, e-mail address, phone number, year of birth, gender, zip code, country, postal address, , user name, password, and password reminder questions and answers. We may ask you for information when you register or subscribe, or at other times—such as when you enter a contest or participate in a promotion, when you provide content, or when you order products from us.  
• Automated information. Using technologies that are widely used on the Internet, such as cookies, web beacons, and other technologies, we also may automatically collect information about your computer or mobile device and online activity when you access the Services. For example, when you visit thedailybeast.com, we may collect your Internet Protocol (IP) address, your browser type and operating system, as well as information about which pages you visit and the page, if any, that referred you to our sites or that you visit after our sites. Similarly, when you use our mobile applications, we may collect information about your mobile device, such as the type of mobile device you use or your device identifier.  
• Location information. When you use the Services, we may collect information about your location separately from your address or other information that you provide to us explicitly. For instance, we may use the GPS feature of your mobile device or your IP address to help determine your geographic location. If you prefer that we not know your geographic location, you will have the option to disable the function when you first use the service in which we collect information about your location (or later, if your mobile device allows you to change the settings after initial download). Disabling the geolocation function may prevent you from using certain features of our Services that require location information.  
• Social networking information. If you log-in to The Daily Beast through a social networking account (e.g., Facebook or Twitter), we may collect information about you from that social networking account, including your name, email address, birthday, profile photograph, and other information associated with your social networking account.  
• Information from other sources. We may combine the information that we collect with information that we obtain from other sources, such as our owners, including IAC, our past and present affiliates, including other IAC companies, and our business partners, licensees, contractors, and service providers. For example, we may ask a service provider to supply us with demographic information or updated contact information for you.

How do you use this information?  
We use the information that we collect about you for these purposes:

• for editorial purposes, such as in connection with our news reporting;  
• to contact you to provide information about The Daily Beast or other products or services in which we believe you may be interested, including legal notices or information about changes to this Privacy Policy or our Terms of Use;  
• to manage your account;  
• to provide you with the products and services you request;  
• to respond to your requests, questions, and comments;  
• to perform business analyses or for other purposes to improve the quality of our business, the products and services we offer, including through surveys and questionnaires;  
• to deliver targeted advertising, as described below;  
• as we believe is necessary to protect our rights and the rights of others, including by enforcing our Terms of Use;  
• and as otherwise described to you at the point of collection or pursuant to your consent.;

We also do research on our users’ demographics, interests, and behavior to help us operate our services, for other business purposes, and in connection with our display of advertising (which we describe below). This research is based on the information you provide to us including upon registration during a promotion, in surveys, and on your use of our services.

With whom do you share this information?  
We may share the information that we collect about you through the Services in these ways:

• with authorized service providers that help us provide the Services or perform other business functions for us, such as sending emails or hosting web services (but these service providers are not permitted to use personally identifiable information that we provide for any purpose other than to provide service to us);  
• with our corporate affiliates, licensees, and contractors, including the IAC family of businesses;  
• in the context of contests or other promotions in which we identify an outside entity, with the identified entity;  
• with select third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes, although you may choose up front and at no cost that we not share personally identifiable information that we have collected about you for these purposes by emailing us at help [at] thedailybeast.com;  
• to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process, in response to a request for cooperation from law enforcement or another government agency, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims;  
• when we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, or as otherwise required by law;  
• to enforce our Terms of Use and other agreements, or otherwise protect or defend our rights or property or the rights or property of others, or the safety of the public;  
• in connection with a corporate transaction, such as a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale;  
• in aggregated or other non-personally identifiable form;  
• and as otherwise described to you at the point of collection or pursuant to your consent.

In addition, if you choose to participate in social features on the Services, such as commenting on a story or chatting with other users, any information that you submit will become public. It may become accessible through search engines or, if you sign in using credentials from a third-party social networking service, to users on that service. Unless otherwise noted, we do not limit the distribution of information that you share using these features.

How do you decide which advertisements to show me on the Services?  
The Services are offered to you free of charge because we cover the cost of providing our Services by displaying advertisements. Many of these advertisements are targeted, which means that advertisers tell us the type of audience they want to reach (for example, men over 25 years old). We will display the advertisement to users meeting those criteria, but we never provide the advertiser with information about the specific individuals who receive the ads. The targeted ads on the Services may be provided by us, or they may be provided by a third-party vendor. You can learn more about targeted ads, including how to opt out of receiving them, below.

Does this Privacy Policy apply to information collected through third-party offerings?  
We sometimes partner with third parties that operate platforms or offer services that you can use to access or otherwise interact with our content and offerings. For example, you can access The Daily Beast on your Apple iPad or iPhone. Similarly, we may include in some of our Services features that integrate with third-party social networking services or other third-party services. To do this, we may include in our web pages and apps code from the social networking service provider or other third party. This code may allow the service provider to collect information about your activities. If you are logged into social networking or other third-party services at the time, the service providers may also be able to identify you in connection with that information.

Although this Privacy Policy will apply to our use of information collected about you through these co-branded offerings, we do not control the privacy practices of our third-party partners. As a result, we want you to be aware that when you use these offerings you may be providing information to both us and our partner, and you should review the partner’s privacy policy to be sure that you know how it will use any data that it collects.

How do you protect the security of the information you store?  
We have in place physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to protect the information we collect through the Services. However, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our database, nor can we guarantee that the information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to us via the Services. Please refer to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission's website for information on how to protect yourself from identity theft.

Do you collect information from children?  
We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. If we learn that we have collected any personal information from a child under the age of 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information from our database promptly.

What are my California privacy rights?  
California law permits residents of California to request certain details about what personal information a company shares with third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. The Daily Beast shares certain personal information with third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes; however, you may choose up front and at no cost that we not share personally identifiable information that we have collected about you for these purposes by emailing us at help [at] thedailybeast.com. Upon receipt of this notification, we will discontinue sharing your information for third party direct marketing purposes as soon as practicable.

What are cookies and web beacons and how are they used on the Services?  
We may use cookies and other technologies to store information on your computer or mobile device. We use this information for a variety of purposes, such as to remember you when you return to our websites or to identify your activities as you use certain Services. To do this, we may store a unique identifier on your computer or device. As described above, advertising service vendors that serve ads into our sites may also use their own cookies or identifiers.

You may opt-out of the browser cookies delivered through the Services by changing the setting on your browser. Please be aware that this will disable all cookies delivered to your browser, not just the ones that we deliver, and that you may not be able to use all of the Services if you do not allow the placement of cookies. Also, opting out of browser cookies will not disable other technologies that we may use to collect information from you, including “Flash cookies.”

You also can opt out of receiving information stored in Adobe Local Shared Objects, which are commonly referred to as “Flash cookies.” You can find more information about Local Shared Objects and how to disable them on Adobe’s website at http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/526/52697ee8.html. As with browser cookies, disabling Local Shared Objects may interfere with the proper functioning of the Services.

We or our third-party partners also may use technologies called web beacons that communicate information from your Internet browser to a web server. Web beacons can be embedded in web pages, videos, or emails, and can allow a web server to read certain types of information from your browser, check whether you have viewed a particular web page or email message, and determine, among other things, the time and date on which you viewed the web beacon, the IP address of your computer, and the URL of the web page from which the web beacon was viewed. We and our partners use web beacons for a variety of purposes, including analyzing the use of the Services and in conjunction with cookies to provide content and ads that are more relevant to you. You may disable our web beacons in email messages by turning off images in your email client (e.g., Outlook, Outlook Express). Please see the instructions for your particular email client for more information. Please also be aware that by turning off images you may not be able to enjoy all of the Services as they were designed to be viewed.

  
What choices do I have regarding your use of information about me?  
Email messages. If you do not wish to receive emailed promotional material from us, you can email us at help [at] thedailybeast.com. Please note that, even if you opt out of receiving promotional emails from us, we may still contact you to provide you with non-commercial messages, such as legal notices. Also, if you opt out, we may not provide to you non-promotional material, such as our emailed newsletters and other content.

Targeted advertising. If you would prefer not to receive advertisements through the Services that are targeted to your interests, you can inform our advertising vendor, Google, Inc., of your preference by clicking the “Opt out” button at http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html. You also can manage your advertising preferences at http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/. In some cases, we and advertisers on the Services work with other third-party vendors to help deliver advertisements targeted to your interests. These vendors include ad networks and analytics providers, and they use cookies or other technologies to collect information about your online activity (e.g., the sites and pages you have visited) in order to help advertisers deliver particular ads that they believe you would find most relevant. Many third-party vendors that perform these functions are members of the Network Advertising Initiative or the Digital Advertising Alliance, and you can opt out of those vendors’ delivery of targeted advertising to you by visiting http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp and http://www.aboutads.info/choices/. Some of our Services use technology for this purpose provided by Adobe. You can express your preferences regarding Adobe’s use of information about you here.

Please note that, because these opt-out tools will place a cookie on your computer to record your opt-out preference, any actions you take using these tools will apply only to the web browser that you use to take the action. Also, these tools may not work as expected if you set your browser to refuse cookies.

Sometimes, our advertisers will contract with a third-party service to host their ads. In this case, an ad-serving vendor contacts the advertisers’ hosting service to obtain a particular advertisement. Because we do not have a relationship with these third parties, we do not have a mechanism to allow visitors to opt out of tracking by these vendors.

Sharing of information collected online. If you would like to opt out of our sharing of personal information that we collect about you through the Services, you can make a request to cancel your registration by emailing us at help [at] thedailybeast.com , explaining your request, and providing your name and email address. Please understand that it may take us a reasonable amount of time to cancel your registration after we receive your request and that your cancellation will not apply to our uses of information about you prior to our receipt of the request. If you make a cancellation request, you should not access the Services again, because we may not be able to preserve your opt-out preferences if you continue to access the Services after we cancel your registration.

The Daily Beast Company LLC is headquartered in the United States. Please be aware that information you provide to us or we obtain as a result of your use of the Services may be collected in your country and subsequently transferred to the United States or another country in accordance with applicable law. The privacy and data protection laws in another country may not be equivalent to such laws in your country of residence.

","As of September 30, 2013

The Daily Beast Company LLC has prepared this Privacy Policy to help you understand more about how we collect, use, and disclose information that we collect about consumers through our web and mobile services, which we refer to in this Privacy Policy collectively as the “Services.”  


This Privacy Policy does not cover information that we collect about you outside of our normal consumer services. For example, it does not cover information that we collect in news reporting or as a part of our business arrangements. Also, this Privacy Policy does not cover information that you voluntarily make public, such as by posting it in a publicly accessible place on the Internet.

What information do you collect about me?  
The information that we collect about you falls into these general categories:  
• Information that you provide. We may collect information that you choose to provide to us (including in comments or other user content that you submit to us or when you subscribe to our newsletter(s)). This may include information such as your name, e-mail address, phone number, year of birth, gender, zip code, country, postal address, , user name, password, and password reminder questions and answers. We may ask you for information when you register or subscribe, or at other times—such as when you enter a contest or participate in a promotion, when you provide content, or when you order products from us.  
• Automated information. Using technologies that are widely used on the Internet, such as cookies, web beacons, and other technologies, we also may automatically collect information about your computer or mobile device and online activity when you access the Services. For example, when you visit thedailybeast.com, we may collect your Internet Protocol (IP) address, your browser type and operating system, as well as information about which pages you visit and the page, if any, that referred you to our sites or that you visit after our sites. Similarly, when you use our mobile applications, we may collect information about your mobile device, such as the type of mobile device you use or your device identifier.  
• Location information. When you use the Services, we may collect information about your location separately from your address or other information that you provide to us explicitly. For instance, we may use the GPS feature of your mobile device or your IP address to help determine your geographic location. If you prefer that we not know your geographic location, you will have the option to disable the function when you first use the service in which we collect information about your location (or later, if your mobile device allows you to change the settings after initial download). Disabling the geolocation function may prevent you from using certain features of our Services that require location information.  
• Social networking information. If you log-in to The Daily Beast through a social networking account (e.g., Facebook or Twitter), we may collect information about you from that social networking account, including your name, email address, birthday, profile photograph, and other information associated with your social networking account.  
• Information from other sources. We may combine the information that we collect with information that we obtain from other sources, such as our owners, including IAC, our past and present affiliates, including other IAC companies, and our business partners, licensees, contractors, and service providers. For example, we may ask a service provider to supply us with demographic information or updated contact information for you.

How do you use this information?  
We use the information that we collect about you for these purposes:

• for editorial purposes, such as in connection with our news reporting;  
• to contact you to provide information about The Daily Beast or other products or services in which we believe you may be interested, including legal notices or information about changes to this Privacy Policy or our Terms of Use;  
• to manage your account;  
• to provide you with the products and services you request;  
• to respond to your requests, questions, and comments;  
• to perform business analyses or for other purposes to improve the quality of our business, the products and services we offer, including through surveys and questionnaires;  
• to deliver targeted advertising, as described below;  
• as we believe is necessary to protect our rights and the rights of others, including by enforcing our Terms of Use;  
• and as otherwise described to you at the point of collection or pursuant to your consent.;

We also do research on our users’ demographics, interests, and behavior to help us operate our services, for other business purposes, and in connection with our display of advertising (which we describe below). This research is based on the information you provide to us including upon registration during a promotion, in surveys, and on your use of our services.

With whom do you share this information?  
We may share the information that we collect about you through the Services in these ways:

• with authorized service providers that help us provide the Services or perform other business functions for us, such as sending emails or hosting web services (but these service providers are not permitted to use personally identifiable information that we provide for any purpose other than to provide service to us);  
• with our corporate affiliates, licensees, and contractors, including the IAC family of businesses;  
• in the context of contests or other promotions in which we identify an outside entity, with the identified entity;  
• with select third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes, although you may choose up front and at no cost that we not share personally identifiable information that we have collected about you for these purposes by emailing us at help [at] thedailybeast.com;  
• to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process, in response to a request for cooperation from law enforcement or another government agency, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims;  
• when we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, or as otherwise required by law;  
• to enforce our Terms of Use and other agreements, or otherwise protect or defend our rights or property or the rights or property of others, or the safety of the public;  
• in connection with a corporate transaction, such as a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale;  
• in aggregated or other non-personally identifiable form;  
• and as otherwise described to you at the point of collection or pursuant to your consent.

In addition, if you choose to participate in social features on the Services, such as commenting on a story or chatting with other users, any information that you submit will become public. It may become accessible through search engines or, if you sign in using credentials from a third-party social networking service, to users on that service. Unless otherwise noted, we do not limit the distribution of information that you share using these features.

The Daily Beast has implemented Google’s Invisible reCAPTCHA technology on our site.  Use of the Invisible reCAPTCHA is subject to the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.

How do you decide which advertisements to show me on the Services?  
The Services are offered to you free of charge because we cover the cost of providing our Services by displaying advertisements. Many of these advertisements are targeted, which means that advertisers tell us the type of audience they want to reach (for example, men over 25 years old). We will display the advertisement to users meeting those criteria, but we never provide the advertiser with information about the specific individuals who receive the ads. The targeted ads on the Services may be provided by us, or they may be provided by a third-party vendor. You can learn more about targeted ads, including how to opt out of receiving them, below.

Does this Privacy Policy apply to information collected through third-party offerings?  
We sometimes partner with third parties that operate platforms or offer services that you can use to access or otherwise interact with our content and offerings. For example, you can access The Daily Beast on your Apple iPad or iPhone. Similarly, we may include in some of our Services features that integrate with third-party social networking services or other third-party services. To do this, we may include in our web pages and apps code from the social networking service provider or other third party. This code may allow the service provider to collect information about your activities. If you are logged into social networking or other third-party services at the time, the service providers may also be able to identify you in connection with that information.

Although this Privacy Policy will apply to our use of information collected about you through these co-branded offerings, we do not control the privacy practices of our third-party partners. As a result, we want you to be aware that when you use these offerings you may be providing information to both us and our partner, and you should review the partner’s privacy policy to be sure that you know how it will use any data that it collects.

How do you protect the security of the information you store?  
We have in place physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to protect the information we collect through the Services. However, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our database, nor can we guarantee that the information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to us via the Services. Please refer to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission's website for information on how to protect yourself from identity theft.

Do you collect information from children?  
We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. If we learn that we have collected any personal information from a child under the age of 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information from our database promptly.

What are my California privacy rights?  
California law permits residents of California to request certain details about what personal information a company shares with third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. The Daily Beast shares certain personal information with third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes; however, you may choose up front and at no cost that we not share personally identifiable information that we have collected about you for these purposes by emailing us at help [at] thedailybeast.com. Upon receipt of this notification, we will discontinue sharing your information for third party direct marketing purposes as soon as practicable.

What are cookies and web beacons and how are they used on the Services?  
We may use cookies and other technologies to store information on your computer or mobile device. We use this information for a variety of purposes, such as to remember you when you return to our websites or to identify your activities as you use certain Services. To do this, we may store a unique identifier on your computer or device. As described above, advertising service vendors that serve ads into our sites may also use their own cookies or identifiers.

You may opt-out of the browser cookies delivered through the Services by changing the setting on your browser. Please be aware that this will disable all cookies delivered to your browser, not just the ones that we deliver, and that you may not be able to use all of the Services if you do not allow the placement of cookies. Also, opting out of browser cookies will not disable other technologies that we may use to collect information from you, including “Flash cookies.”

You also can opt out of receiving information stored in Adobe Local Shared Objects, which are commonly referred to as “Flash cookies.” You can find more information about Local Shared Objects and how to disable them on Adobe’s website at kb2.adobe.com/cps/526/52697ee8.html. As with browser cookies, disabling Local Shared Objects may interfere with the proper functioning of the Services.

We or our third-party partners also may use technologies called web beacons that communicate information from your Internet browser to a web server. Web beacons can be embedded in web pages, videos, or emails, and can allow a web server to read certain types of information from your browser, check whether you have viewed a particular web page or email message, and determine, among other things, the time and date on which you viewed the web beacon, the IP address of your computer, and the URL of the web page from which the web beacon was viewed. We and our partners use web beacons for a variety of purposes, including analyzing the use of the Services and in conjunction with cookies to provide content and ads that are more relevant to you. You may disable our web beacons in email messages by turning off images in your email client (e.g., Outlook, Outlook Express). Please see the instructions for your particular email client for more information. Please also be aware that by turning off images you may not be able to enjoy all of the Services as they were designed to be viewed.

  
What choices do I have regarding your use of information about me?  
Email messages. If you do not wish to receive emailed promotional material from us, you can email us at help [at] thedailybeast.com. Please note that, even if you opt out of receiving promotional emails from us, we may still contact you to provide you with non-commercial messages, such as legal notices. Also, if you opt out, we may not provide to you non-promotional material, such as our emailed newsletters and other content.

Targeted advertising. If you would prefer not to receive advertisements through the Services that are targeted to your interests, you can inform our advertising vendor, Google, Inc., of your preference by clicking the “Opt out” button at google.com/privacy_ads.html. You also can manage your advertising preferences at google.com/ads/preferences/. In some cases, we and advertisers on the Services work with other third-party vendors to help deliver advertisements targeted to your interests. These vendors include ad networks and analytics providers, and they use cookies or other technologies to collect information about your online activity (e.g., the sites and pages you have visited) in order to help advertisers deliver particular ads that they believe you would find most relevant. Many third-party vendors that perform these functions are members of the Network Advertising Initiative or the Digital Advertising Alliance, and you can opt out of those vendors’ delivery of targeted advertising to you by visiting networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp and aboutads.info/choices/. Some of our Services use technology for this purpose provided by Adobe. You can express your preferences regarding Adobe’s use of information about you here.

Our properties may feature Nielsen proprietary measurement software, which will allow you to contribute to market research, such as Nielsen TV Ratings. To learn more about the information that Nielsen software may collect and your choices with regard to it, please see the Nielsen Digital Measurement Privacy Policy at nielsen.com/digitalprivacy.

Please note that, because these opt-out tools will place a cookie on your computer to record your opt-out preference, any actions you take using these tools will apply only to the web browser that you use to take the action. Also, these tools may not work as expected if you set your browser to refuse cookies.

Sometimes, our advertisers will contract with a third-party service to host their ads. In this case, an ad-serving vendor contacts the advertisers’ hosting service to obtain a particular advertisement. Because we do not have a relationship with these third parties, we do not have a mechanism to allow visitors to opt out of tracking by these vendors.

If you would like to opt out of our sharing of personal information that we collect about you through the Services, you can make a request to cancel your registration by emailing us at help [at] thedailybeast.com , explaining your request, and providing your name and email address. Please understand that it may take us a reasonable amount of time to cancel your registration after we receive your request and that your cancellation will not apply to our uses of information about you prior to our receipt of the request. If you make a cancellation request, you should not access the Services again, because we may not be able to preserve your opt-out preferences if you continue to access the Services after we cancel your registration.

The privacy and data protection laws in another country may not be equivalent to such laws in your country of residence. By using and participating in the Services or providing us with your information, you consent to the collection, international transfer, storage, and processing of your information.

For other, non-SAP sites, the site's owner's privacy policy will be referenced. It is SAP's practice to require such suppliers and business partners to handle information in a manner consistent with SAP's privacy statement.

We may also use IP addresses or other information, as further explained in Subsection 5 (Automated Tools) below you have shared on this website or at any earlier occasion or a campaign code, to determine which pages on our sites you visit and which topics may be of interest to you so we can provide you with information about relevant products and services.

SAP may also collect IP addresses (and other technical information such as browser type) during a Click-to-Chat or Click-to-Call session that you initiate. This information is collected when you connect to SAP so that we may identify your session, deliver content based on the technical capabilities of your browser, and for quality control purposes. Your IP address will not be used to identify you unless you provide your prior consent.

SAP will only gather information related to your visit to the SAP site. We do not track or collect Personal Data from your visits to companies or entities outside the SAP Group of companies beyond the information stated above in the Subsection III. (Collection and Processing of Your Personal Data).

In addition to the information you provide, SAP may also collect information during your visit to a SAP website through Automated Tools, which include Web beacons, cookies, embedded Web links, and other commonly used information-gathering tools. These tools collect certain standard information that your browser sends to our website such as your browser type and language, access times, and the address of the website from which you arrived at an SAP website. Using these tools, SAP is also able to confirm receipt of e-mails that the recipient consented to receive, and can track other information such as pages visited on the relevant SAP site and whether or not the recipient registers for an event offered by SAP and certain other aggregate data that is not related to a particular individual.

Unless another means to make your choice is listed below, you may refuse the use of Automated Tools like cookies (i) if the relevant website supports TRUSTe Consent Manager by clicking on the respective link in the footer of the website or, (ii) if TRUSTe Consent Manager is not available, by selecting the appropriate settings in your browser. Kindly note that in the latter case the settings in your browser regarding cookies are limited to the particular browser installed on a particular device and that, as a consequence, if you visit SAP’s websites with different browsers or different devices, you have to disable the tracking cookies in the browsers of all relevant devices. However kindly further note that if you do this you may not be able to use the full functionality of the relevant site.

SAP is in particular currently using the following Automated Tools for the purposes set out below.

#### a. Adobe Analytics

Some websites which refer to this Privacy Statement use Adobe Analytics. Adobe Analytics uses IP addresses to establish the approximate region where a user is coming from. Therefore, Adobe Analytics collects the full IP address of users in a first step and then anonymizes it in a second step. Only the anonymized IP address is used to determine the approximate location from where a user is accessing a certain website.

Furthermore, if you are a registered user and logged on, SAP uses Adobe Analytics to track your user ID together with how you use the relevant website.

In addition to an opt-out by way of the TRUSTe Consent Manager (where available) you can opt-out of the use of Adobe Analytics by using this link: http://sap.d1.sc.omtrdc.net/optout.html?optout=1&confirm_change=1

#### b. Adobe Target

Some websites which refer to this Privacy Statement use Adobe Target. Adobe Target assigns a user ID to each user who does not opt-out of the tracking as described below and then creates a user profile based on this user ID by adding information about the user’s (i) browser and other device specific information, (ii) information about usage behavior and (iii) location data. Location data is collected by way of analyzing the user’s anonymized IP address: Adobe Target collects the full IP address of users in a first step and then anonymizes it in a second step. Only the anonymized IP address is used to determine the approximate location from where a user is accessing a certain website.

This information is used to display targeted content on the SAP group websites using Adobe Target.

In addition to an opt-out by way of the TRUSTe Consent Manager (where available) you can opt-out of the use of Adobe Analytics by using this link: http://sap.d1.sc.omtrdc.net/optout.html?optout=1&confirm_change=1

#### c. Google Analytics

Some websites which refer to this Privacy Statement use Google Analytics. Google Analytics uses cookies, which are text files placed on your computer to help the website analyze how users use the site. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the website (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the website, compiling reports on site activity for site operators and providing other services relating to site activity and internet usage.

Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google's behalf. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google.

In addition to an opt-out by way of TRUSTe Consent Manager (where available), Google has developed the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on. It provides website visitors more choice on how their data is collected by Google Analytics. The add-on communicates with the Google Analytics JavaScript (ga.js) to indicate that information about the website visit should not be sent to Google Analytics. It can be downloaded here: http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en

#### d. SAP Web Analytics

Some websites which refer to this Privacy Statement use SAP Web Analytics (“SWA”). SWA helps to analyze how users use the relevant site. The information generated (including a part of your IP address and a browser-ID) will be transmitted to and stored by SAP. SAP will use this information only for the purpose of evaluating your use of the website and compiling reports on website activity for website operators – and finally, to improve SAP’s websites.

Each website which uses SWA contains a separate statement regarding such use and provides for an option of the user to opt-out of the tracking by SWA either directly in the relevant statement or by way of the TRUSTe Consent Manager which can be reached over a link on the relevant page (where available).

#### e. Usage tracking for marketing purposes

SAP websites may collect the way you are accessing and using such websites by other means in order to prepare usage profiles that are used to determine which content is the most appropriate to be displayed while you visit a certain website.

In this case, SAP is capturing your usage behavior (websites visited, point in time a website has been visited, activity on a website/clicks made on (objects of) a website, browser type, operating or computing system used, referring website from which you have accessed a SAP website, the location from where you access a website) together with a unique identifier (like your IP address or a cookie ID) that allows SAP to establish that there is a certain person active on its websites but no information like your name that can be used to directly identify you. SAP will use the collected information only in order to display appropriate and relevant content on its websites.

You may opt-out of this tracking (i) if the relevant website supports TRUSTe Consent Manager by clicking on the respective link in the footer of the website or, (ii) if TRUSTe Consent Manager is not available, by selecting the appropriate settings in your browser. Kindly note that in the latter case the settings in your browser are limited to the particular browser installed on a particular device and that, as a consequence, if you visit SAP’s websites with different browsers or different devices, you have to make the respective adjustments in the browsers of all relevant devices. However kindly further note that depending on the settings made in your browser(s) you may not be able to use the full functionality of the relevant site.

#### f. Embedded Web Links

Emails from SAP often use links designed to lead you to a relevant area on the Web, after redirection through SAP's servers. The redirection system allows SAP to change the destination URL of these links, if necessary, and to determine the effectiveness of our marketing initiatives.

In emails, such links may also allow SAP to determine if you have clicked on a link in the email, and the information about this interaction may be connected to your personal identity. If you do not want SAP to collect information about the links you clicked, you can simply choose not to click on the links in an e-mail that SAP sends you.

#### g. Cookies

Cookies are identifiers that can be sent from a site via your browser to be placed on your computer's hard drive. SAP uses cookies to deliver personalized content, to save you having to re-enter your password or complete registration forms repeatedly, to keep track of your shopping cart, and to tailor our information offerings to how you and others use the site.

We offer to you the following two ways to make your choice regarding SAP’s use of cookies:

aa. Some websites of SAP use the TRUSTe Consent Manager to enable users to make their choices regarding SAP’s use of cookies. Wherever the TRUSTe Consent Manager is used, you will find in a footer a link to it. Please click on that link to access the TRUSTe Consent Manager and to make your choice regarding SAP’s use of cookies.

bb. In case a SAP website does not use the TRUSTe Consent Manager, you may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings in your browser. Kindly note that the settings in your browser regarding cookies is limited to the particular browser installed on a particular device and that, as a consequence, if you visit SAP’s websites with different browsers or different devices, you have to disable the cookies in the browsers of all relevant devices. Furthermore, please note that if you disable cookies you may not be able to use the full functionality of a website.

##  6\. Sharing Your Personal Data

As a member of a global group of companies, SAP operates a number of websites around the world. Any data and information that you volunteer or that is otherwise collected on one of our sites in any one country may be sent electronically to a server for one of these sites in another country. Such servers or other types of data processing facilities may be located within or outside the European Economic Area or third countries that are regarded by the EU Commission as featuring an adequate level of data protection. However, we safeguard your privacy interests around the world by ensuring that this SAP website adheres to our data protection principles described in this statement. All companies of the SAP group (including, for the avoidance of doubt, all SAP companies as well as all Ariba, SuccessFactors, Hybris, Sybase, Business Objects, Fieldglass, Concur, Multiposting and SeeWhy companies) may use the information internationally in connection with processing your inquiries and orders, in order to provide services to you, to help improve our products and services to keep you up to date about the latest IT product announcements, software updates, software upgrades, security patches, system enhancements, special offers, for processing and storage and for all other purposes set out in the section “Use and Purpose of Collected Personal Data” above. This includes that all companies of the SAP group may provide you with marketing materials if (depending on the country in which the relevant SAP group company operates) you have granted your prior consent and/or unless you have opted out of receiving marketing materials.

We may also share such information with business partners, service vendors, authorized third-party agents or contractors (such as Google, Inc. or Adobe Systems Inc.) in order to provide a requested service or transaction, including processing orders, processing credit card transactions, hosting websites, hosting event and seminar registration and providing customer support, providing you with information on products and services that may be of interest to you or in order to analyze the user behavior on our webpages (e.g. in case of Adobe Analytics or Google Analytics).

We only provide these third parties with the minimum amount of Personal Data necessary to provide the services on our behalf, and the third parties are (where legally required) bound by appropriate order data processing agreements and/or comprehensive confidentiality undertakings and therefore not permitted to use your Personal Data except for the limited purpose of completing the requested service or transaction.

We do not sell or rent your Personal Data to third parties for marketing purposes unless you have granted us permission to do so.

We may respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process by disclosing your Personal Data and other related information, if necessary. We also may choose to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.

Circumstances may arise where, whether for strategic or other business reasons, SAP decides to sell, buy, merge or otherwise reorganize businesses in some countries. Such a transaction may involve, in accordance with applicable law, the disclosure of Personal Data to prospective or actual purchasers, or the receipt of it from sellers. It is SAP's practice to seek appropriate protection for information in these types of transactions.

We may collect and share Personal Data and any other additional information available to us in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of SAP's terms of use, or as otherwise required by law.

While visiting SAP's website you may be directed to content or functionality that is hosted by a third-party supplier. Most often, this is done to host special events, such as contests or seminars. When information is collected on behalf of SAP exclusively, the appropriate SAP entity's privacy statement will be referenced on the website and will govern how information is used. For other, non-SAP sites, the site's owner's privacy policy will be referenced. It is SAP's practice to require such suppliers and business partners to handle information in a manner consistent with SAP's privacy statement.

58,31168,"['Security', 'opens', 'new window', 'collected information', 'preferences', 'Introduction', 'customers', 'fca US']","Welcome to FCA US LLC (""FCA US""). At FCA US, we believe it is important to protect the privacy of our customers and guests and to be transparent with our practices. We know that you care about how your personal information is collected, used, and shared and we want to help you make knowledgeable choices about the information you provide to us. This Privacy Statement (""Privacy Statement"") explains and summarizes how FCA US collects, uses, and protects your information, including the personal information that you may provide to us or that we may collect from you as you interact with us. We will update this Privacy Statement from time to time, so please check back with us periodically.

This Privacy Statement applies when FCA US collects data from customers and guests, including through FCA US controlled websites or applications, and FCA US controlled applications accessed and/or used on a mobile, handheld or other wirelessly connected device (a ""Website"" or ""Application""). Any Personal Information you provide is voluntary. ""Personal Information"" includes information that alone or when in combination with other information may be used to readily identify, contact, or locate you (e.g., name, address, telephone number, email address, and location). By disclosing your Personal Information to us or using our Websites or Applications, you consent to its collection and use by FCA US consistent with applicable data protection law and this Privacy Statement (which is expressly incorporated into any applicable Website or Application terms of use).

This Privacy Statement explains the information practices of FCA US including:

  * How FCA US uses the personal information you share with us and that we learn about you because of our relationship.
  * How FCA US uses ""cookies"" and related information collected when you use our Website or Applications.
  * What personal information, if any, FCA US may share about you and the conditions we use to protect your information if it must be shared.
  * What kind of security measures FCA US takes to protect your information from accidental loss or disclosure.
  * How FCA US will inform you in the event of a security breach.
  * The process through which you can access personal information you share with FCA US and have that Personal Information corrected, restricted or removed from our records.
  * Other things you should know about FCA US and privacy.



FCA US collects and uses the information you provide to us. We may also obtain information about you from outside sources. For example, we may obtain commercially available demographic information about you from third parties, get device identifier information from mobile applications or advertisements or purchase e-mail or similar lists from third parties for advertising and marketing purposes. We may use or share your Personal Information where it is necessary for us to complete a transaction or do something that you have asked us to do, like to ""get a quote"" or to ""find a dealer"" or to send you products or vehicle information. We may also use this information for our internal research purposes as we develop our products and services. We may use Personal Information and data collected for our advertising or marketing purposes including on other websites or media and we may communicate with you to provide you with information we think may be of interest to you.

If you make a request for information, for example, we might need to provide your name, address, or email to one of our dealers or a service provider with whom we have a relationship so that they can help us respond to you. FCA US vendors and suppliers may process your personal data under the direction of FCA US and in accordance with our policies.

We collect and use information from you in certain ways including:

Website or Application Usage. We (or our service providers) may observe your activities, preferences, and transactional data (such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address and browser type) as well as pages you have viewed during your use of our Website or Application. We may use this data for any purpose unless we tell you otherwise in connection with a particular Website or Application. While we may collect or log this information, we do not identify you except if we believe doing so will help us better respond to a request you have made such as for a quote, identification of a local dealer, or similar request. With the exception of Location-Data, described below, where such non-Personal Information is linked to your Personal Information we will treat such information as Personal Information.

Location Data. Some FCA US Websites or Applications may capture and record certain location-data regarding your use of that Website or Application and your travels in order to provide location-related functionality (""Location Data""). We may link that Location Data to other information that you provide to us or that may be accessed in connection with your use of such a FCA US Website or Application. Your use of, and our ability to offer location based functionality is then enabled through our use and disclosure to third parties of Location Data and associated information.

E-Commerce. When you interact with us or purchase a FCA US product online (for example, to get a quote or locate a dealer) you will be asked for information needed to complete your request. The information you provide is used, for example, to process your transactions, to create and share reports about these transactions, or to provide related customer service. When you shop online or buy direct from one of our online stores, these purchase transactions may be conducted through FCA US vendors and suppliers. Vendors and suppliers engaged by FCA US may have their use of your Personal Information limited by this Privacy Statement, contractual restrictions, or applicable law. However, if a particular Website or Application is co-branded or developed by a third party, it is possible that another party's Privacy Statement will govern the treatment of information on that Website or Application. FCA US (through its vendors or suppliers) may limit the acceptance of orders to particular jurisdictions and as permitted by applicable law.

Product Registration and Support. FCA US may allow customers to register online. Personal Information provided for such purposes may be used to carry out the request, service, or agreement for which the information is submitted. With your consent, we may also use the information you provide in online registration forms to notify you periodically about important things like an update to the Application, a change to our Privacy Statement or notice of a security breach, new FCA US products and services, and special offers and promotions that may be of interest to you. Failure to register any FCA US product will not diminish the rights you have under the applicable product warranty.

Events and Promotions. You may be asked to provide an email address or other Personal Information at an event or for entry into a particular promotion (including sweepstakes and contests). The specific rules and regulations governing promotions will vary and your participation constitutes your agreement to abide by those rules and regulations.

Certain promotions may be run by a FCA US service provider or vendor or be co-branded with one of our partners or run on a third party site like Facebook. In these instances the collection of your Personal Information may occur directly by the service provider or vendor or by a third-party partner on their website. The promotion will state the policies governing the collection of such information if they should differ from this Privacy Statement.

You may opt out or control how your information is used by sending an email to dprivacy@fcagroup.com.

Cookies and Related Technologies. Cookies are small lines of text/data that are written onto your computer by website. FCA US or others acting on our behalf may use cookies, pixel tags, web beacons or other similar technologies in connection with the operation of our Websites or Applications. These technologies may collect and store non-Personal Information. We utilize these technologies to research and understand how our Websites and Applications are used, to develop our products and services, to personalize your online experience with FCA US and for general advertising and marketing purposes. We may share data collected from you on our Websites with our third party vendors or suppliers to advertise or market to you on other sites as you browse the web. At the end of your visit, session cookies used by FCA US are removed. However, in some instances some FCA US cookies may persist. For example, to customize your experience we may require registration to recognize your computer and save your previously selected settings or vehicle options. It is possible that Cookies placed by FCA US or its vendors or suppliers (as applicable) in connection with the operation of the Website or Application may remain stored on your computer until you remove them or until they expire.

Our service providers or vendors may also use cookies and related technologies in order to personalize your experiences and adapt a particular FCA US Website or Application's functionality to your preferences and for purposes such as those listed above. If you are visiting a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) other than our brand websites (www.chrysler.com, www.jeep.com, www.ramtrucks.com,  www.dodge.com, www.fiatusa.com, www.alfaromeousa.com, www.mopar.com, www.drivesrt.com, www.fcausllc.com) or other FCA US Websites or Applications, you should carefully review the privacy policies of those web sites or applications. You may set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie or to refuse receiving it. You should be aware that this may interfere with or make you unable to use certain functionality on websites using cookies. Disabling or removing cookies may require you to manually log on each time you wish to visit that website.

Do Not Track (DNT).Because there is no common understanding about how websites should handle ""do not track"" signals (DNT), FCA US currently does not respond to these requests. Once a recognized standard is established, we will reconsider our approach and update our privacy policy accordingly.

DAA Principles for Behavioral Advertising. FCA US participates in the industry Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising managed by the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA)(www.aboutads.info). As part of this service, FCA US online advertisements are sometimes delivered with icons that help consumers understand how data about them is being used and provide choice options for consumers that want more control and an ability to opt out of such behavioral (targeted) advertising. FCA US (and/or our partners) may use data collected on our websites to customize advertisements to you on other sites as you browse the web. Please click on the DAA icon or the icon in our targeted advertisements to opt out if you do not want your browsing behavior used for online behavioral advertising purposes.

Children. FCA US Websites or Applications are not directed at children. If you are under 18 or otherwise would be required to have parent or guardian consent to share information with FCA US, you should not send any information about yourself to us. If a person under 13 submits information through any part of a FCA US Website or Application, and we learn the person submitting the information is a child, we will attempt to delete this information as soon as possible. Because we do not knowingly collect any Personal Information from persons under 13, we do not use or disclose such information to third parties.

FCA US may share your Personal Information within our enterprise to fulfill our obligations to you and operate our business consistent with this Privacy Statement and applicable data protection law. We may also share your Personal Information with third parties in certain situations, including:

FCA US Affiliates, Vendors and Suppliers. ""Affiliates"" include FCA US dealers, companies that are part of the FCA US LLC family of companies, , FCA US partners or their respective subsidiaries, employees, and supplemental workers. Vendors and suppliers are companies who perform services for FCA US or its dealers. To the extent it is necessary for these groups to provide their products and services to us and provide products and services you have requested, these third parties may have access to or process your Personal Information. FCA US may sometimes permit our authorized service providers to have access to aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns, and related Website or Application information. These transfers of aggregate statistics do not involve Personal Information.

Recruitment and Job Applications. Personal information such as that contained on a resume or curriculum vitae may be submitted in connection with a job application or inquiry. We may use this information throughout FCA US (worldwide) for the purpose of employment consideration or your inquiry. We may keep your information on file for future consideration.

Enabling Services. FCA US offers a variety of services and functions through its Websites and Applications. Personal Information that is collected through a Website or Application may be used and/or disclosed to third parties in order to enable us to provide functionality or services to you. For example, some FCA US Websites and Applications allow you to interface with third party websites or applications. To facilitate that connection, we may use your Personal Information and/or disclose your Personal Information to third parties. When we provide location based services enabled through a third party, we may share data with those services in order to provide the related location based service or functionality.

Public Areas. Any information disclosed in public areas of a FCA US Website or Application or third party website (for example, through Facebook, YouTube, Twitter or other sites) will become public information. We cannot control the use of information disclosed in public forums, such as social media platforms, blogs, forums, wikis, chat rooms, and networking functions of mobile-device applications. You should exercise caution when disclosing information in these public areas, especially your Location Data, and be careful how you disclose your Personal Information. Content posted in public areas of FCA US Websites or Applications, including advice and opinions, represent the views and is the responsibility of those who post the content. FCA US may not endorse, support, verify, or agree with the content posted. If you have any questions or comments about any content on a FCA US Website or Application please send an email to:dprivacy@fcagroup.com.

Mergers, Acquisitions, and Insolvency. If FCA US should ever file for bankruptcy or merge with another company, or if FCA US should decide to buy, sell, or reorganize some part or all of its business, FCA US may be required to disclose your Personal Information, including to prospective or actual purchasers in connection with one of these transactions.

As Required by Law and Other Extraordinary Disclosures. FCA US may be required to disclose your Personal Information if it: (i) believes it is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process (such as a court order, subpoena, search warrant, etc.) or other legal requirements of any governmental authority, (ii) would potentially mitigate our liability in an actual or potential lawsuit or investigation, (iii) is otherwise necessary to protect our rights or property, or (iv) is necessary to protect the legal rights or property of others.

Data transmissions over the Internet cannot be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Consequently, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your information we make reasonable efforts to ensure security on our systems. FCA US uses secure server software (e.g. SSL) and firewalls to protect your information from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of such firewalls and secure server software.

If FCA US learns of a security system's breach, we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. By providing Personal Information to us or using this Website or Application, you agree that we can communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy, and administrative issues. FCA US may post a notice on our Website or through an Application if a security breach occurs. If this happens, you can view the notice on a FCA US Website or Application. FCA US may also send an email to you at the email address you have provided to us in these circumstances. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive free written notice of a security breach (or to withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice) you should send an email to dprivacy@fcagroup.com.

Our Websites and Applications may contain links to third party websites or may be co-branded. Please be aware that FCA US is not responsible for and cannot control the privacy practices of other websites or third parties. We encourage you to read the privacy policies for these other websites, as they may differ from ours. Our Websites and Applications may also be created and maintained by service providers or may contain links to co-branded websites that may display the FCA US logo and trademarks but which are maintained by third parties. Such websites may be identified by the fact that they do not display a FCA US (or FCA US brand) URL or they may have information identifying a third party as the host of the particular Website or Application.

## COLLECTED INFORMATION AND USE

FCA US collects and uses the information you provide to us. We may also obtain information about you from outside sources. For example, we may obtain commercially available demographic information about you from third parties, get device identifier information from mobile applications or advertisements or purchase e-mail or similar lists from third parties for advertising and marketing purposes. We may use or share your Personal Information where it is necessary for us to complete a transaction or do something that you have asked us to do, like to ""get a quote"" or to ""find a dealer"" or to send you products or vehicle information. We may also use this information for our internal research purposes as we develop our products and services. We may use Personal Information and data collected for our advertising or marketing purposes including on other websites or media and we may communicate with you to provide you with information we think may be of interest to you.

If you make a request for information, for example, we might need to provide your name, address, or email to one of our dealers or a service provider with whom we have a relationship so that they can help us respond to you. FCA US vendors and suppliers may process your personal data under the direction of FCA US and in accordance with our policies.

We collect and use information from you in certain ways including:

Website or Application Usage. We (or our service providers) may observe your activities, preferences, and transactional data (such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address and browser type) as well as pages you have viewed during your use of our Website or Application. We may use this data for any purpose unless we tell you otherwise in connection with a particular Website or Application. While we may collect or log this information, we do not identify you except if we believe doing so will help us better respond to a request you have made such as for a quote, identification of a local dealer, or similar request. With the exception of Location-Data, described below, where such non-Personal Information is linked to your Personal Information we will treat such information as Personal Information.

Location Data. Some FCA US Websites or Applications may capture and record certain location-data regarding your use of that Website or Application and your travels in order to provide location-related functionality (""Location Data""). We may link that Location Data to other information that you provide to us or that may be accessed in connection with your use of such a FCA US Website or Application. Your use of, and our ability to offer location based functionality is then enabled through our use and disclosure to third parties of Location Data and associated information.

E-Commerce. When you interact with us or purchase a FCA US product online (for example, to get a quote or locate a dealer) you will be asked for information needed to complete your request. The information you provide is used, for example, to process your transactions, to create and share reports about these transactions, or to provide related customer service. When you shop online or buy direct from one of our online stores, these purchase transactions may be conducted through FCA US vendors and suppliers. Vendors and suppliers engaged by FCA US may have their use of your Personal Information limited by this Privacy Statement, contractual restrictions, or applicable law. However, if a particular Website or Application is co-branded or developed by a third party, it is possible that another party's Privacy Statement will govern the treatment of information on that Website or Application. FCA US (through its vendors or suppliers) may limit the acceptance of orders to particular jurisdictions and as permitted by applicable law.

Product Registration and Support. FCA US may allow customers to register online. Personal Information provided for such purposes may be used to carry out the request, service, or agreement for which the information is submitted. With your consent, we may also use the information you provide in online registration forms to notify you periodically about important things like an update to the Application, a change to our Privacy Statement or notice of a security breach, new FCA US products and services, and special offers and promotions that may be of interest to you. Failure to register any FCA US product will not diminish the rights you have under the applicable product warranty.

Events and Promotions. You may be asked to provide an email address or other Personal Information at an event or for entry into a particular promotion (including sweepstakes and contests). The specific rules and regulations governing promotions will vary and your participation constitutes your agreement to abide by those rules and regulations.

Certain promotions may be run by a FCA US service provider or vendor or be co-branded with one of our partners or run on a third party site like Facebook. In these instances, the collection of your Personal Information may occur directly by the service provider or vendor or by a third-party partner on their website. The promotion will state the policies governing the collection of such information if they should differ from this Privacy Statement.

## NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION, COOKIES, AND RELATED INFORMATION COLLECTION

Cookies and Related Technologies. Cookies are small lines of text/data that are written onto your computer by website. FCA US or others acting on our behalf may use cookies, pixel tags, web beacons or other similar technologies in connection with the operation of our Websites or Applications.

We utilize these technologies to research and understand how our Websites and Applications are used, to develop our products and services, to personalize your online experience with FCA US and for general advertising and marketing purposes. We may share data collected from you on our Websites with our third party vendors or suppliers to advertise or market to you on other sites as you browse the web.

It is possible that Cookies placed by FCA US or its vendors or suppliers (as applicable) in connection with the operation of the Website or Application may remain stored on your computer until you remove them or until they expire.

FCA US (and/or our partners) may use data collected on our websites to customize advertisements to you on other sites as you browse the web. Please click on the DAA icon or the icon in our targeted advertisements to opt out if you do not want your browsing behavior used for online behavioral advertising purposes.

You provide most such information when you search, signup for an account, book facilities, events, activities and/or communicate with customer service. For example, you provide information when you search for an event; place an booking through SAFRA; communicate with us by phone, e-mail, or otherwise; complete a questionnaire or a contest entry form.

","## What Personal Information About Members Does SAFRA Gather? 

The information we learn from customers helps us personalize and continually improve your experience at SAFRA. Here are the types of information we gather. 

Information You Give Us: We receive and store any information you enter on our Web site or give us in any other way. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing future features for you, improving our services, and communicating with you.   
Automatic Information: We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many Web sites, we use ""cookies,"" and we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses SAFRA. A number of companies offer utilities designed to help you visit Web sites anonymously. Although we will not be able to provide you with a personalized experience at SAFRA if we cannot recognize you, we want you to be aware that these tools exist.   
E-mail Communications: To help us make e-mails more useful and interesting, we often receive a confirmation when you open e-mail from SAFRA if your computer supports such capabilities. We also compare our membership list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our customers. If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please click here to unsubscribe. 

## What About Cookies? 

Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and to provide features such as a global login for SAFRA’s website and its Online Services.   
The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. However, cookies allow you to take full advantage of some of SAFRA's features, and we recommend that you leave them turned on. 

## Does SAFRA Share the Information It Receives?

Information about our members is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling it to others. We share customer information only as described below and with subsidiaries controls that either are subject to this Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Notice. 

Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control: We work closely with our affiliated businesses. In some cases, these businesses operate stores at SAFRA or sell offerings to you at SAFRA. In other cases, we operate stores, provide services, or sell product lines jointly with these businesses.   
Third-Party Service Providers (if applicable): We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.   
Promotional Offers: Sometimes we send offers to selected groups of SAFRA customers on behalf of other businesses. When we do this, we do not give that business your name and address. If you do not want to receive such offers, please click here to unsubscribe.   
Protection of SAFRA and Others: We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our Disclaimer and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of SAFRA, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. Obviously, however, this does not include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this Privacy Notice.   
With Your Consent: Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when information about you might go to third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.   
How Secure Is Information About Me? 

We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input.   
We reveal only the last five digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing.   
It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer.   
Which Information Can I Access? 

SAFRA gives you access to a broad range of information about your account and your interactions with SAFRA for the limited purpose of viewing and, in certain cases, updating that information. 

What Choices Do I Have? 

As discussed above, you can always choose not to provide information, even though it might be needed to make a purchase or to take advantage of such SAFRA features as Your Profile, Online Booking, etc.   
You can add or update certain information on pages such as those listed in the ""Which Information Can I Access?"" section above. When you update information, we usually keep a copy of the prior version for our records.   
If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please click here to unsubscribe. (If you do not want to receive Disclaimer and other legal notices from us, such as this Privacy Notice, those notices will still govern your use of SAFRA, and it is your responsibility to review them for changes.)   
The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether.   
The Federal Trade Commission provides useful information about online privacy on its own Web site, Site Seeing on the Internet.

All Nokia Siemens Networks sites to which this Policy is applicable are collectively referred to as this ""site"".

In the event of any inconsistency between any special terms and this Policy, the applicable special terms will prevail over the terms of this Policy. 

Anonymous Use  
In general, most of this site's pages are provided for informational purposes and you will be able to use this site without telling Nokia Siemens Networks who you are or providing Nokia Siemens Networks with any personal data about yourself. There are times, however, when in connection with your use of this site Nokia Siemens Networks may need information about you. 

Personal Data Provided by You   
To respond to your questions, fulfill your requests or manage interactive customer programs, it may be necessary to ask for or obtain personal data. If you provide us with any personal data, we may use it to respond to your requests, customize your user experience with us, determine your satisfaction with Nokia Siemens Networks products and/or services or contact you via mail, e-mail, mobile message or phone, or, in accordance with local law, contact you via the aforementioned channels to inform you of new products, services or promotions we may offer. By providing information to Nokia Siemens Networks through this site, you acknowledge and consent to the collection, use and disclosure of personally identifying information of the type and for the limited purposes described in this Policy.

You expressly accept and give your consent that your personal data obtained in connection with your use of this site may be transferred, if permitted by applicable local legislation, across international borders to server locations supporting this site (including but not limited to transfers from those locations back to the country of your location) for operating and developing this site and Nokia Siemens Networks services, including transfers to Nokia Siemens Networks subcontractors or agents, as mentioned below, who perform tasks related to this site, or Nokia Siemens Networks services, or for the purposes of storing the data in relevant databases, which may be located in Finland or in any other country where Nokia Siemens Networks has operations.

Visitor Identification - Usage of ""Cookies""   
From time to time, information may be placed on your computer to improve this site and Nokia Siemens Networks services for you.

They typically enable collection of certain information about your computer, including your internet protocol address, your computer's operating system, your browser type and the address of any referring sites.

The use of cookies provides benefits to you, such as eliminating the need for you to enter your password frequently during a session, or, where applicable, re-enter items you place in a shopping cart from visit to visit if you do not finish a transaction on an earlier visit. By showing how and when our visitors use this site or other Nokia Siemens Networks sites, the use of cookies allows Nokia Siemens Networks to continue to improve the sites. If you do not wish to receive cookies, or want to be notified of when they are placed, you may set your web browser to do so, if your browser so permits. Please understand that if cookies are turned off, you may not be able to view certain parts of this site that may enhance your visit. Some of our business partners whose content is linked to or from this site may also use cookies. However, we have no access to or control over these cookies. This site also makes use of cookies for website traffic analysis and anonymous demographic profiling.

Security   
Nokia Siemens Networks have endeavored to take commercially reasonable measures to prevent unauthorized access to and improper use of your personal data submitted to Nokia Siemens Networks via your use of this site. For example, Nokia Siemens Networks uses encryption technology when collecting financial personal data such as credit card information. If this site supports on-line transactions, it will use an industry standard security measure, such as the one available through ""Secure Sockets Layer"" (""SSL""), to protect the confidentiality and security of online transactions. If used, industry standard security measures like SSL authentication ensure that credit card information, as well as other personal data submitted as part of the buying process, is reasonably safe from third party interception.

While there are always risks associated with providing personal data, whether in person, by phone or via the internet or other technologies, and no system of technology is completely safe or ""tamper""/""hacker"" proof, Nokia Siemens Networks has endeavored to take reasonable precautions which are appropriate to the nature of the information to prevent and minimize such risks in connection with your use of this site.

Nokia Siemens Networks will on its own initiative, or at your request, free of charge, replenish, rectify or erase any incomplete, inaccurate or outdated personal data retained by Nokia Siemens Networks in connection with the operation of this site.

### Why we need your information and where we obtain it 

Our main use of your personal information is to look after your account or to provide the specific service you require. Some details we obtain elsewhere - from credit reference agencies or your employer for instance. If you apply to us for insurance, we will pass your details to the insurer. If you make a claim, any information you give to us, or to the insurer, may be put onto a register of claims and shared with other insurers to prevent fraudulent claims. A list of the participants is available from the insurer.

To meet the requirements of our regulator, the Financial Services Authority (FSA), we are obliged to contact you shortly before the maturity of any fixed term or fixed rate products. This ensures that you are aware of the options available and helps you make an informed decision about your maturity instructions.

To comply with money laundering regulations, there are times when we need to confirm (or reconfirm) the name and address of our customers. For more details about identity checks, please ask for our leaflet ""Your Personal Details - How to help us Prevent Crime"".

We may record phone conversations to offer you additional security, resolve complaints and improve our service standards. Conversations may also be monitored for staff training purposes.

Our employees are personally responsible for maintaining customer confidentiality. We provide training and education to all our staff to remind them about their obligations. Our policies and procedures are regularly audited and reviewed.

top

### How we use your information 

The Data Protection Act puts obligations on users of personal information and lays down principles for its use. One principle states that information has to be processed fairly and lawfully. This means that you are entitled to know how we intend to use any information you provide. You can then decide whether you want to give it to us.

Organisations must lodge a notification with the Information Commissioner describing the purposes for which they process personal information. The details are publicly available from the Commissioner's office at Wycliffe House, Water Lane, Wilmslow, Cheshire SK9 5AF. (Tel 01625 545745. Fax 01625 524510). Alternatively, see the Commissioner's website (www.informationcommissioner.gov.uk).

Unless you have given us your consent, we will not provide information about you to companies outside our group to use for their own marketing purposes. Sometimes we need to give information to our agents and subcontractors so that they can provide a particular service for us. Sometimes, these companies may be located abroad in countries that do not have adequate data protection laws. In these circumstances we always take great care to ensure that your personal information is kept safe and secure. Where appropriate, details relating to your Nectar Card and number of points earned will be passed, via Sainsbury's Supermarkets Ltd, to LMUK Ltd so that they can administer the Nectar Programme. If you hold a credit card with us, we will share transaction details with our scheme providers (e.g. Visa or MasterCard). Other members of our group may also share your information (but not financial details) to help keep their records up to date and administer your relationship with them.

We are also committed to meeting the standards set by the Lending Code, copies of which are available on their website http://www.lendingstandardsboard.org.uk Occasionally, the Lending Standards Board's compliance monitoring body audits a sample of our customer records to assess our compliance with the Code.  Whenever this happens, strict confidentiality conditions are always imposed.

top

### Your choices and how to contact us 

We may use your account details, transactions and information provided to us by third parties in our customer contact programme. Occasionally, we and other parts of J Sainsbury plc, may contact you by letter, telephone, e-mail and text message or otherwise to inform you about other products and services that may interest you. We try to limit our customer contact programme to acceptable levels, but if you wish to exercise your right to opt out, simply write to us at Freepost RSCB-HXYE-YXAT, Sainsbury's Bank, PO Box 197, Prescot, L35 1WR. Alternatively, you may e-mail us at sainsburysnocontact@cdms.co.uk.  Please confirm your name and address on all communications.  Your request may take up to eight weeks to action.

Please note however that opting out could stop us contacting you about any of our products or services that may benefit you. For example, you may not hear about a new savings product that offers you a better rate or a discount that may save you money.

Under the Data Protection Act you have the right of access to your personal data. The Act allows us to charge a fee of £10 for this service. If anything is inaccurate or incorrect, please let us know and we will correct it. If you do not want to receive unsolicited mail from other companies, you can prevent this by registering with the Mailing Preference Service. In addition, the Telephone and Fax Preference Services enable you to object to receiving unsolicited marketing phone calls or faxes from other companies. To register, simply telephone the appropriate number i.e.

Mailing Preference - 020 7291 3310  
Telephone Preference - 020 7291 3320  
Fax Preference - 020 7291 3330

Alternatively, you can register online. For more details about all the Preference Services, please see the Direct Marketing Association's web site (www.dma.org.uk).

### Credit Referencing 

If you apply for any of our credit-based products (e.g. loan or credit card) we will perform searches with credit reference agencies. We may give details of your account and how you conduct it to credit reference agencies. If you borrow and do not repay in full and on time, we may tell credit reference agencies who will record the outstanding debt. 

The information below provides further details about how credit reference agencies, Sainsbury's Bank and other lenders use your information.

What is a credit reference agency?

Credit reference agencies (CRAs) collect and maintain information on consumers' and businesses' credit behaviour, on behalf of lenders in the UK.

What is a fraud prevention agency?

Fraud Prevention Agencies (FPAs) collect, maintain and share information on known and suspected fraudulent activity. Some CRAs also act as FPAs.

Why do you use them when I have applied to your organisation?

Although you have applied to Sainsbury's Bank and we will check our own records, we will also contact CRAs to get information on your credit behaviour with other organisations. This will help us make the best possible assessment of your overall situation before we make a decision.

Where do they get the information?

Publicly available information: -

  * The Electoral Register at Local Authorities 
  * County Court Judgments from Registry Trust
  * Bankruptcy information from the Insolvency Service
  * Fraud information from fraud prevention agencies 
  * Credit information comes from information on applications to banks, building societies, credit card companies etc and also from the conduct of those accounts



How will I know if my information is to be sent to a CRA or FPA?

You will be told when you apply for an account if your data will be supplied. The next section tells you how, when and why we will search at CRAs and what we will do with the information we obtain from them. We will also tell you if we plan to send payment history information on you, if you have one, to CRAs. You can ask at any time for the name of the CRAs and FPAs used by Sainsbury's Bank.

Why is my data used in this way?

We and other organisations want to make the best possible decisions we can, in order to make sure that you will be able to repay us. Some organisations may also use the information to check your identity. In this way we can ensure that we all make responsible decisions. At the same time we also want to make decisions quickly and easily and, by using up to date information, provided electronically, we are able to make the most reliable and fair decisions possible.

Who controls what credit reference agencies are allowed to do with my data?

All organisations that collect and process personal data are regulated by the Data Protection Act 1998, overseen by the Office of the Information Commissioner. All credit reference agencies are in regular dialogue with the Commissioner. Use of the Electoral Register is controlled under the Representation of the People Act 2000.

Can just anyone look at my data held at credit reference agencies?

No, access to your information is very strictly controlled and only those that are entitled to do so may see it. Usually that will only be with your agreement or (very occasionally) if there is a legal requirement.

### Please read this section very carefully  
What Sainsbury's Bank does: 

1\. When you apply to us to open an account, we will:-

  1. Check our own records for information on:- 
    * Your personal accounts; 
    * And, if you have one, your spouse/(personal) partner's personal accounts (A personal partner will be someone with whom you have a relationship that creates a joint financial unit in a similar way to a married couple. You will normally, but not necessarily, be living at the same address. It is not intended to include temporary arrangements such as students or flat sharers); 
    * If you are a director or partner in a small business we may also check on your business accounts (A small business is defined as an organisation, which might be sole trader, partnership or a limited company that has three or less partners or directors). 
  2. Search at credit reference agencies for information on:- 
    * Your personal accounts:- 
    * And, if you have ever done the following we will check your financial associates personal accounts as well:- 
      * Made a joint application now; 
      * Previously made joint applications; 
      * Have joint account(s); 
      * Are financially linked (Credit reference agencies may link together the records of people that are part of a financial unit. They may do this when people are known to be linked, such as being married or have jointly applied for credit or have joint accounts. They may also link people together if they, themselves, state that they are financially linked.) 
      * If there is insufficient information to enable us to assist you, we may also check other members of your family 
      * If you are a director or partner in a small business we may also check on your business accounts; 
      * Search at fraud prevention agencies for information on you and other members of your household and your business (if you have one) 



2\. What we do with the information you supply to us as part of the application:-

  1. Information that is supplied to us will be sent to the credit reference agencies. 
  2. If you tell us that you have a spouse or (personal) partner, we will:- 
    * Search, link and/or record information at credit reference agencies about you both. 
    * Link joint applicants and/or any individual identified as your spouse or partner, in our own records. 
    * Take both your and their information into account in future applications by either or both of you. 
    * Continue this linking until the account closes, or is changed to a sole account and one of you notifies us that you are no longer linked.  
So you must be sure that you have their agreement to disclose information about them.
  3. If you give us false or inaccurate information and we suspect fraud, we will record this and may also pass this information to financial and other organisations involved in fraud prevention to protect us, them and our respective customers from theft and fraud. 
  4. Your data may also be used by this organisation, to offer you other products, but only if you have given your permission.

  5. Manage your personal account with us. 
  6. Undertake periodic statistical analysis or testing to ensure the accuracy of existing and future products and services. 
  7. Any or all of these processes may be automated. 



4\. What we do when you have an account:-

  1. Where you borrow or may borrow from us, we will give details of your personal account including names and parties to the account and how you manage it/them to credit reference agencies. 
  2. If you borrow and do not repay in full and on time, we will tell credit reference agencies. 
  3. We may make periodic searches of our records, credit reference and fraud prevention agencies to manage your account with us, to take decisions regarding your identity and also credit, including whether to make credit available or to continue or extend existing credit. 
  4. If you have borrowed from us and do not make payments that you owe us, we will trace your whereabouts and recover payment.

### What credit reference agencies do 

5\. When credit reference agencies receive a search from us they will:-

  1. Place a search ""footprint"" on your credit file whether or not this application proceeds. If the search was for a credit application the record of that search (but not the name of the organisation that carried it out) may be seen by other organisations when you apply for credit in the future. 
  2. Link together the records of you and anyone that you have advised is your financial associate including previous and subsequent names of parties to the account. Links between financial associates will remain on your and their files until such time as you or your partner successfully files for a disassociation with the credit reference agencies. 



6\. Supply to us:-

  1. Credit information such as previous applications and the conduct of the accounts in your name and of your associate(s) (if there is a link between you - see 1b above) 
  2. Public information such as County Court Judgments (CCJs) and bankruptcies. 
  3. Electoral Register information. 
  4. Fraud prevention information. 



7\. When information is supplied by us, to them, on your account(s):-

  1. Credit reference agencies will record the details that are supplied on your personal account including previous and subsequent names of parties to the account and how you manage it/them. 
  2. If you borrow and do not repay in full and on time, credit reference agencies will record the outstanding debt. 
  3. Records shared with credit reference agencies remain on file for 6 years after they are closed whether settled by you or defaulted. 



8\. How your data will NOT be used by credit reference agencies:-

  1. It will not be used to create a blacklist. 
  2. It will not be used by the credit reference agency to make a decision. 



9\. How your data WILL be used by credit reference agencies:-

  1. The information which we, other organisations and fraud prevention agencies provide to the credit reference agencies about you and your financial associates may be supplied by credit reference agencies to other organisations and used by them to:- 
    * Verify your identity if you or your financial associate applies for other facilities including all types of insurance applications and claims. 
    * Make decisions on credit, credit related services and on motor, household, life and other insurance proposals and insurance claims, about you, your partner, other members of your household or your business. 
    * Trace your whereabouts and recover payment if you do not make payments that you owe. 
    * Conduct checks for the prevention and detection of crime including fraud and/or money laundering. 
    * Manage your personal, your partners and/or business account (if you have one). 
    * Manage your personal, your partners and/or business insurance policies (if you have one/any). 
    * Undertake statistical analysis and system testing. 
  2. Your data may also be used for other purposes for which you give your specific permission or, in very limited circumstances, when required by law or where permitted under the terms of the Data Protection Act 1998.

We try to limit our customer contact programme to acceptable levels, but if you wish to exercise your right to opt out, simply write to us at Freepost RRZC-LYZB-SKYA, Sainsbury's Bank, PO Box 445, Halifax, HX1 9GN. Alternatively, you may e-mail us at sainsburysnocontact@st-ives.co.uk

Please confirm your name and address on all communications.  Your request may take up to eight weeks to action.

Please note however that opting out could stop us contacting you about any of our products or services that may benefit you. For example, you may not hear about a new savings product that offers you a better rate or a discount that may save you money.

Under the Data Protection Act you have the right of access to your personal data. The Act allows us to charge a fee of £10 for this service. If anything is inaccurate or incorrect, please let us know and we will correct it. If you do not want to receive unsolicited mail from other companies, you can prevent this by registering with the Mailing Preference Service. In addition, the Telephone and Fax Preference Services enable you to object to receiving unsolicited marketing phone calls or faxes from other companies. To register, simply telephone the appropriate number i.e.

Mailing Preference - 020 7291 3310  
Telephone Preference - 020 7291 3320  
Fax Preference - 020 7291 3330

Alternatively, you can register online. For more details about all the Preference Services, please see the Direct Marketing Association's web site (www.dma.org.uk).

## Why we need your information and where we obtain it 

Our main use of your personal information is to look after your account or to provide the specific service you require. Some details we obtain elsewhere - from credit reference agencies or your employer for instance. If you apply to us for insurance, we will pass your details to the insurer. If you make a claim, any information you give to us, or to the insurer, may be put onto a register of claims and shared with other insurers to prevent fraudulent claims. A list of the participants is available from the insurer.

To meet the requirements of our regulator, the Financial Services Authority (FSA), we are obliged to contact you shortly before the maturity of any fixed term or fixed rate products. This ensures that you are aware of the options available and helps you make an informed decision about your maturity instructions.

To comply with money laundering regulations, there are times when we need to confirm (or reconfirm) the name and address of our customers. For more details about identity checks, please ask for our leaflet ""Your Personal Details - How to help us Prevent Crime"".

We may record phone conversations to offer you additional security, resolve complaints and improve our service standards. Conversations may also be monitored for staff training purposes.

Our employees are personally responsible for maintaining customer confidentiality. We provide training and education to all our staff to remind them about their obligations. Our policies and procedures are regularly audited and reviewed.

## How we use your information 

The Data Protection Act puts obligations on users of personal information and lays down principles for its use. One principle states that information has to be processed fairly and lawfully. This means that you are entitled to know how we intend to use any information you provide. You can then decide whether you want to give it to us.

Organisations must lodge a notification with the Information Commissioner describing the purposes for which they process personal information. The details are publicly available from the Commissioner's office at Wycliffe House, Water Lane, Wilmslow, Cheshire SK9 5AF. (Tel 01625 545745. Fax 01625 524510). Alternatively, see the Commissioner's website (www.informationcommissioner.gov.uk).

Unless you have given us your consent, we will not provide information about you to companies outside our group to use for their own marketing purposes. Sometimes we need to give information to our agents and subcontractors so that they can provide a particular service for us. Sometimes, these companies may be located abroad in countries that do not have adequate data protection laws. In these circumstances we always take great care to ensure that your personal information is kept safe and secure. Where appropriate, details relating to your Nectar Card and number of points earned will be passed, via Sainsbury's Supermarkets Ltd, to Aimia Coalition Loyalty UK Limited so that they can administer the Nectar Programme. If you hold a credit card with us, we will share transaction details with our scheme providers (e.g. Visa or MasterCard). Other members of our group may also share your information (but not financial details) to help keep their records up to date and administer your relationship with them.

We are also committed to meeting the standards set by the Lending Code, copies of which are available on their website http://www.lendingstandardsboard.org.uk Occasionally, the Lending Standards Board's compliance monitoring body audits a sample of our customer records to assess our compliance with the Code.  Whenever this happens, strict confidentiality conditions are always imposed.

Some Acts of Parliament oblige us to disclose information about our customers to certain bodies with statutory powers. For example, we must give information to authorised benefit fraud investigators where fraudulent benefit claims are suspected. In addition, the Inland Revenue has the statutory authority to audit our customers' accounts from time to time.

If you apply to us for a credit-based product, the details you provide, the information we already have and information from credit reference agencies are used to assess credit risk using a technique called ‘credit scoring’. Various factors in all these details help us to assess the risk. A score is given to each factor and a total credit score obtained. If your score is above a confidential pre-set pass score, the application is likely to succeed.

If you e-mail us, or give us your e-mail address, we will keep a record of it. We, and other parts of the J Sainsbury's Group, including Sainsbury's energy and phone services, may use it to keep their records up to date, administer your relationship with them and contact you occasionally about other products and services, which may interest you, unless you ask us not to do so. We will not give your e-mail address to any unauthorised third parties. When e-mailing us, we recommend you use the e-mail facility on our websites to make sure that the content of your e-mail is secure. If you send us e-mail in other ways, remember that it will be ‘insecure’ and could be intercepted. If you do send us ‘insecure’ email, please keep the amount of confidential information you include to a minimum. We will do likewise when we reply. With your permission, we may also send you text messages containing administrative information about your relationship with us. You can ask us to stop sending these messages at any time.

Cookies are small text files placed on your computer and are commonly used on the internet. We may use cookies to help provide you with our online services.

The Data Protection Act defines certain information as ‘sensitive’ (racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious beliefs, trade union membership, physical or mental health, sexual life, criminal proceedings and offences). If you apply to us for insurance, a pension, health insurance or life assurance, we may ask you for some ‘sensitive’ details. We will only use this information to provide the service you require and we will ask for your explicit consent. As a Sainsbury's Bank customer, there may be times when you give us sensitive information. We may share it with our subcontractors to keep your records up to date. Some transactions that you (or an additional cardholder) make on a card account may cause sensitive or confidential details to appear on your statement. If your card is used for such transactions, we believe that the details appear on your statement with your explicit consent.

## Credit Referencing 

If you apply for any of our credit-based products (e.g. loan or credit card) we will perform searches with credit reference agencies. We may give details of your account and how you conduct it to credit reference agencies. If you borrow and do not repay in full and on time, we may tell credit reference agencies who will record the outstanding debt.

The information below provides further details about how credit reference agencies, Sainsbury's Bank and other lenders use your information.

What is a credit reference agency?

Credit reference agencies (CRAs) collect and maintain information on consumers' and businesses' credit behaviour, on behalf of lenders in the UK.

What is a fraud prevention agency?

Fraud Prevention Agencies (FPAs) collect, maintain and share information on known and suspected fraudulent activity. Some CRAs also act as FPAs.

Why do you use them when I have applied to your organisation?

Although you have applied to Sainsbury's Bank and we will check our own records, we will also contact CRAs to get information on your credit behaviour with other organisations. This will help us make the best possible assessment of your overall situation before we make a decision.

Where do they get the information?

Publicly available information: -

  * The Electoral Register at Local Authorities 
  * County Court Judgments from Registry Trust
  * Bankruptcy information from the Insolvency Service
  * Fraud information from fraud prevention agencies 
  * Credit information comes from information on applications to banks, building societies, credit card companies etc and also from the conduct of those accounts



How will I know if my information is to be sent to a CRA or FPA?

You will be told when you apply for an account if your data will be supplied. The next section tells you how, when and why we will search at CRAs and what we will do with the information we obtain from them. We will also tell you if we plan to send payment history information on you, if you have one, to CRAs. You can ask at any time for the name of the CRAs and FPAs used by Sainsbury's Bank.

Why is my data used in this way?

We and other organisations want to make the best possible decisions we can, in order to make sure that you will be able to repay us. Some organisations may also use the information to check your identity. In this way we can ensure that we all make responsible decisions. At the same time we also want to make decisions quickly and easily and, by using up to date information, provided electronically, we are able to make the most reliable and fair decisions possible.

Who controls what credit reference agencies are allowed to do with my data?

All organisations that collect and process personal data are regulated by the Data Protection Act 1998, overseen by the Office of the Information Commissioner. All credit reference agencies are in regular dialogue with the Commissioner. Use of the Electoral Register is controlled under the Representation of the People Act 2000.

Can just anyone look at my data held at credit reference agencies?

No, access to your information is very strictly controlled and only those that are entitled to do so may see it. Usually that will only be with your agreement or (very occasionally) if there is a legal requirement.

## What Sainsbury's Bank does

Please read this section very carefully.

1\. When you apply to us to open an account, we will:-

  1. Check our own records for information on:- 
    * Your personal accounts; 
    * And, if you have one, your spouse/(personal) partner's personal accounts (A personal partner will be someone with whom you have a relationship that creates a joint financial unit in a similar way to a married couple. You will normally, but not necessarily, be living at the same address. It is not intended to include temporary arrangements such as students or flat sharers); 
    * If you are a director or partner in a small business we may also check on your business accounts (A small business is defined as an organisation, which might be sole trader, partnership or a limited company that has three or less partners or directors).   
   
  2. Search at credit reference agencies for information on:- 

Your personal accounts:- 

    * And, if you have ever done the following we will check your financial associates personal accounts as well:

Made a joint application now;  
Previously made joint applications;  
Have joint account(s);   
Are financially linked (Credit reference agencies may link together the records of people that are part of a financial unit. They may do this when people are known to be linked, such as being married or have jointly applied for credit or have joint accounts. They may also link people together if they, themselves, state that they are financially linked.);   
If there is insufficient information to enable us to assist you, we may also check other members of your family;   
If you are a director or partner in a small business we may also check on your business accounts; and   
Search at fraud prevention agencies for information on you and other members of your household and your business (if you have one).




2\. What we do with the information you supply to us as part of the application:-

  1. Information that is supplied to us will be sent to the credit reference agencies. 
  2. If you tell us that you have a spouse or (personal) partner, we will:- 
    * Search, link and/or record information at credit reference agencies about you both. 
    * Link joint applicants and/or any individual identified as your spouse or partner, in our own records. 
    * Take both your and their information into account in future applications by either or both of you. 
    * Continue this linking until the account closes, or is changed to a sole account and one of you notifies us that you are no longer linked.  
So you must be sure that you have their agreement to disclose information about them.
  3. If you give us false or inaccurate information and we suspect fraud, we will record this and may also pass this information to financial and other organisations involved in fraud prevention to protect us, them and our respective customers from theft and fraud. 
  4. Your data may also be used by this organisation, to offer you other products, but only if you have given your permission. 



3\. With the information that we obtain we will:-

  1. Assess this application for credit and/or; 
  2. Verify your identity and the identity of your spouse/partner and/or; 
  3. Undertake checks for the prevention and detection of fraud and/or money laundering. 
  4. We may use scoring methods to assess this application and to verify your identity. 
  5. Manage your personal account with us. 
  6. Undertake periodic statistical analysis or testing to ensure the accuracy of existing and future products and services. 
  7. Any or all of these processes may be automated. 



4\. What we do when you have an account:-

  1. Where you borrow or may borrow from us, we will give details of your personal account including names and parties to the account and how you manage it/them to credit reference agencies. 
  2. If you borrow and do not repay in full and on time, we will tell credit reference agencies. 
  3. We may make periodic searches of our records, credit reference and fraud prevention agencies to manage your account with us, to take decisions regarding your identity and also credit, including whether to make credit available or to continue or extend existing credit. 
  4. If you have borrowed from us and do not make payments that you owe us, we will trace your whereabouts and recover payment. 



## What credit reference agencies do 

5\. When credit reference agencies receive a search from us they will:-

  1. Place a search ""footprint"" on your credit file whether or not this application proceeds. If the search was for a credit application the record of that search (but not the name of the organisation that carried it out) may be seen by other organisations when you apply for credit in the future. This may affect your ability to obtain credit elsewhere in the near future.
  2. Link together the records of you and anyone that you have advised is your financial associate including previous and subsequent names of parties to the account. Links between financial associates will remain on your and their files until such time as you or your partner successfully files for a disassociation with the credit reference agencies. 



6\. Supply to us:-

  1. Credit information such as previous applications and the conduct of the accounts in your name and of your associate(s) (if there is a link between you - see 1b above) 
  2. Public information such as County Court Judgments (CCJs) and bankruptcies. 
  3. Electoral Register information. 
  4. Fraud prevention information. 



7\. When information is supplied by us, to them, on your account(s):-

  1. Credit reference agencies will record the details that are supplied on your personal account including previous and subsequent names of parties to the account and how you manage it/them. 
  2. If you borrow and do not repay in full and on time, credit reference agencies will record the outstanding debt. 
  3. Records shared with credit reference agencies remain on file for 6 years after they are closed whether settled by you or defaulted. 



8\. How your data will NOT be used by credit reference agencies:-

  1. It will not be used to create a blacklist. 
  2. It will not be used by the credit reference agency to make a decision. 



9\. How your data WILL be used by credit reference agencies:-

  1. The information which we, other organisations and fraud prevention agencies provide to the credit reference agencies about you and your financial associates may be supplied by credit reference agencies to other organisations and used by them to:- 
    * Verify your identity if you or your financial associate applies for other facilities including all types of insurance applications and claims. 
    * Make decisions on credit, credit related services and on motor, household, life and other insurance proposals and insurance claims, about you, your partner, other members of your household or your business. 
    * Trace your whereabouts and recover payment if you do not make payments that you owe. 
    * Conduct checks for the prevention and detection of crime including fraud and/or money laundering. 
    * Manage your personal, your partners and/or business account (if you have one). 
    * Manage your personal, your partners and/or business insurance policies (if you have one/any). 
    * Undertake statistical analysis and system testing. 
  2. Your data may also be used for other purposes for which you give your specific permission or, in very limited circumstances, when required by law or where permitted under the terms of the Data Protection Act 1998. 
  3. Your data may also be used to offer you other products, but only if you have given your permission. That will be on the front of any form that you have completed.

## Fraud Prevention Agencies 

We have systems that protect our customers and ourselves against fraud and other crime. Customer information can be used to prevent crime and trace those responsible. If false or inaccurate information is provided and fraud is identified, details will be passed to fraud prevention agencies. Law enforcement agencies may access and use this information.

  * Checking details on applications for credit and credit related or other facilities 
  * Managing credit and credit related accounts or facilities 
  * Recovering debt 
  * Checking details on proposals and claims for all types of insurance

Merriam-Webster.com may also use other third-party providers to facilitate the delivery of the services described above, and these third-party providers may be supplied with or have access to personally identifiable information for the sole purpose of providing these services, such as Word of the Day,to you on behalf of Merriam-Webster.com.

Merriam-Webster may also disclose personally identifiable information in special legal circumstances. For instance, such information may be used where it is necessary to protect our copyright or intellectual property rights, or if the law requires us to do so.

Anonymous Information

Anonymous aggregated data may be provided to other companies we do business with for statistical purposes. For example, we may report to advertisers that a certain percentage of our site's visitors are adults between the ages of 25 and 35.

Cookies and Beacons—Use by Merriam-Webster; Opting Out

We use cookies and software logs to monitor the use of Merriam-Webster.com and to gather non-personal information about visitors to the site. Cookies are small files that Merriam-Webster transfers to the hard drives of visitors for record-keeping purposes. These monitoring systems allow us to track general information about our visitors, such as the type of browsers (for example, Firefox or Internet Explorer), the operating systems (for instance, Windows or Macintosh), or the Internet providers (for instance, Comcast) they use. This information is used for statistical and market research purposes to tailor content to usage patterns and to provide services requested by our customers. To delete these cookies, please see your browser's privacy settings.

A beacon is an electronic file object (typically a transparent image) placed in the code of a Web page. We use third party beacons to monitor the traffic patterns of visitors from one Merriam-Webster.com page to another and to improve site performance.

None of the information we gather in this way can be used to identify any individual who visits our site.

Cookies and Beacons—Use by Third-Parties; Opting Out

Advertisers and advertising networks use cookies and beacons to target ads served to Merriam-Webster.com. What does it mean to ""serve ads""? When you visit a Web site, your Internet browser transmits a ""request"" to the computer that hosts the Web site (the ""host server"") requesting that server to send you (or ""serve"") the Web page that you are seeking. Most Web pages contain components that are pulled from different sources, for example, a Web page at a news site may get its weather section from one provider, its sports results from a different source, and advertisements from other servers. Our Web pages contain coding that directs your browser to fill the ad spaces on the Web pages with content served by advertisers and networks of advertisers to whom we have sold the ad spaces. The advertisers and networks use cookies and beacons to help manage ad delivery and frequency, and to identify audience segment(s) for customized advertising (""targeting""). These cookies are used to identify your IP address, so that when you visit another Web site using the same advertising network, the network will recognize the cookie as one of its own, read the information on the cookie (the record of which sites in the network you have visited) and serve you an ad that you might be interested in, based on your past visits to other sites in the network. Advertising targeted based on past Web surfing is known as ""behavioral advertising.""

Merriam-Webster does not permit any advertisers or networks to collect personally identifiable information about visitors to Merriam-Webster.com using cookies or beacons. Our Privacy Policy does not cover the use of information that they may have collected from you on other sites. If you would like to learn more about behavioral advertising or to opt out of having this information used by companies that are part of the Network Advertising Initiative to deliver targeted ads, please visit http://www.networkadvertising.org. Many of the same companies are members of the Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. You can learn more and opt out of receiving targeted ads from them at http://www.aboutads.info/choices.

Some advertising networks require that we specifically list their opt-out links below. When you opt-out of a network, you may receive an ""opt-out"" cookie so that the network will know not to assign you new cookies in the future. You will continue to receive ads from that network, but not behaviorally targeted ads. If you erase your browser's cookies, you may need to perform this process again.

","Updated June 9, 2015

About Our Ads and our Privacy Policy together explain how we and some of the companies we work with collect, use, share and protect information in relation to our Web sites, mobile application services and any software provided on or in connection with Merriam-Webster services (collectively, the ""Services"") and your choices about the collection and use of your information. The Services are general audience services, intended for Users (visitors and subscribers) of all ages. Our free Services are supported by advertising. Our subscription Web sites are paid for by subscription fees, and are ad-free, as are our paid-for mobile applications. If you would like to avoid ads, sign up for a subscription or upgrade your mobile application. This Privacy Policy does not govern the use of data that Users provide directly to advertisers or third party partners; that usage is governed by the advertiser’s or third party partner’s privacy policy.

Your use of our Services is governed by our Terms of Use. PLEASE NOTE, OUR TERMS OF USE CONTAIN DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES AND LIABILITY, A BINDING ARBITRATION CLAUSE AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER. THESE PROVISIONS AFFECT YOUR RIGHTS ABOUT HOW TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE WITH MERRIAM-WEBSTER, INCLUDING UNDER THIS PRIVACY POLICY. PLEASE REVIEW. YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES IS ACCEPTANCE OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND OUR TERMS OF USE.

## Personally Identifiable Information (""PII"") We Collect and How We Use It

Merriam-Webster protects the identity of visitors to the Services by limiting the collection of personally identifiable information. For certain promotions and to access certain features, such as to receive a Word of the Day subscription, we may request a voluntary submission of personally identifiable information such as name, e-mail address, city, state, and age.

Merriam-Webster does not knowingly collect or solicit personally identifiable information from or about children under 13, except as permitted by law. If we discover we have received any information from a child under 13 in violation of this policy, we will delete that information immediately. If you believe Merriam-Webster has any information from or about anyone under 13, please e-mail us at privacy@m-w.com.

All personally identifiable information you provide to us for subscriptions through the Services is used by Merriam-Webster and its staff to process and manage subscriptions, analyze the demographic of our subscribers, or to deliver services through the site; such information may also be used by the company for prize or information-request fulfillment unless otherwise indicated. Such information will not be posted or published by us, and will be shared with third parties only for the purpose of payment processing.

If you choose to provide personally identifiable information to us, you may receive the following types of e-mails from us:

  * E-mails related to subscription-maintenance activities.
  * Periodic e-mail newsletters highlighting new features, content, and usage tips for the Services.
  * Periodic special offers for additional Merriam-Webster and Encyclopædia Britannica (Merriam-Webster's parent company) products and services.
  * Periodic special offers from Merriam-Webster approved partners if you ""opt-in"" or give us your permission to send them.



When you provide personally identifiable information to us, you can let us know that you do not wish to receive special Merriam-Webster or partner offers. Each offer will also have information available to allow you to ""opt out"" if you wish to receive no further offers.

The Services may also use other third-party providers to facilitate the delivery of the services described above, and these third-party providers may be supplied with or have access to personally identifiable information for the sole purpose of providing these services, such as Word of the Day, to you on behalf of Merriam-Webster.

Merriam-Webster may also disclose personally identifiable information in special legal circumstances. For instance, such information may be used where it is necessary to protect our copyright or intellectual property rights, or if the law requires us to do so.

You can update your personal information and change your marketing preferences at any time by sending an email to privacy@m-w.com.

## Non-Personally Identifiable Information (""Non-PII"") We Collect and How We Use It

Like other commercial Web sites, we collect information about consumer activities and behaviors to improve our services, provide standard advertising controls, determine user response to advertisements and promotions, deliver targeted advertisements that we or our partners believe will be of most interest to you, and prepare aggregated reports. In addition, we have implemented Google Analytics Demographics and Interest reporting, which is a Google Analytics Advertiser feature. This tool uses cookies (see ""Cookie and Beacons – Use by Merriam-Webster; Opting Out"" below) to collect and store standard Internet log and visitor information on our behalf, including information about what pages you visit, how long you are on our sites, how you got here, and what you click on during your visit. This Google Analytics data is not tied to PII, so this information cannot be used to identify who you are. We use the data provided by Google Analytics Demographics and Interest reports to develop our services and content around our User demographics, interests, and behavior on our Services. You can opt out of this Google Analytics Advertiser feature using the Ads Settings located at https://www.google.com/settings/ads. In addition, you can use the Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-on to disable tracking by Google Analytics.

## Anonymous Information

Anonymous aggregated data may be provided to other companies we do business with for statistical purposes. For example, we may report to advertisers that a certain percentage of our site's visitors are adults between the ages of 25 and 35.

## Device Identifiers.

When you use a mobile device like a tablet or cell phone to access our services, we may access and monitor one or more ""device identifiers."" Device identifiers are small data files associated with your mobile device that uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may deliver information to us or a third party partner about how you browse and use the services and may help us or others provide reports or personalized ads. Some features of the services may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled.

## Cookies and Beacons – Use by Merriam-Webster; Opting Out

Together with Google Analytics, we use cookies and software logs to monitor the use of the Services and to gather non-PII about visitors to the site. Cookies are small files that Merriam-Webster transfers to the hard drives of visitors for record-keeping purposes. These monitoring systems allow us to track general information about our visitors, such as the type of browsers (for example, Firefox or Internet Explorer), the operating systems (for instance, Windows or Macintosh), or the Internet providers (for instance, Comcast) they use. This information is used for statistical and market research purposes to tailor content to usage patterns and to provide services requested by our customers. We also use Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting to collect information using cookies about our user demographics and interests (see ""Non-Personally Identifiable Information (""Non-PII"" We Collect and How We Use It"" above for more information about how we use this data and how to opt out). To delete these cookies, please see your browser's privacy settings or follow the above instructions.

A beacon is an electronic file object (typically a transparent image) placed in the code of a Web page. We use third party beacons to monitor the traffic patterns of visitors from one Web page to another and to improve site performance for each Service.

None of the information we gather in this way can be used to identify any individual who visits our site.

## Cookies and Beacons – Use by Third-Parties; Opting Out

Advertisers and advertising networks use cookies and beacons to target ads served to Merriam-Webster Online, including Google and DoubleClick. What does it mean to ""serve ads""? When you visit a Web site, your Internet browser transmits a ""request"" to the computer that hosts the Web site (the ""host server"") requesting that server to send you (or ""serve"") the Web page that you are seeking.

Advertising targeted based on past Web surfing is known as ""behavioral advertising.""

Merriam-Webster does not permit any advertisers or networks to collect personally identifiable information about visitors to the Services using cookies or beacons.

You can learn more and opt out of receiving targeted ads from them at http://www.aboutads.info/choices.

Some advertising networks require that we specifically list their opt-out links below. When you opt-out of a network, you may receive a ""opt-out"" cookie so that the network will know not to assign you new cookies in the future. You will continue to receive ads from that network, but not behaviorally targeted ads. If you erase your browser's cookies, you may need to perform this process again.

This statement is intended to give you an overview of how we ensure this protection, what kinds of data we collect and why, and how we deal with it.

## 1\. Who is responsible?

Responsibility for data processing and in connection with this website rests with Roland Berger Strategy Consultants GmbH, HighLight Towers, Mies-van-der-Rohe-Str. 6, 80807 Munich, Germany (""Roland Berger Strategy Consultants""). For more detailed information about Roland Berger Strategy Consultants, please see Contact.

## 2\. Why do we collect, process and use data?

Roland Berger Strategy Consultants uses the Internet to present general information about our company and what we do. There are some areas of our web-sites or individual pages which serve more specific purposes.

  * There is the applicants' area of our different recruiting websites, where potential applicants can apply for jobs, internships and other positions.
  * Then there's our alumni area, where people who used to work for Roland Berger Strategy Consultants can keep in touch with their ex-colleagues and the company itself
  * And there are other pages on specific topics or with specific functions. Details can be found in the contents section of each page.



We collect, process and use data for the reasons above, unless there are more specific reasons, which we will give when collecting that data. We do not use data other than for its intended purpose in each case.

## 3\. What data do we collect?

## 3.1 Some data is collected automatically

When you visit our websites, your IP address is recorded, along with the data you requested from the website, how much data you downloaded, the server reply code on the request from your browser, what browser you used, the date you visited, and for how long.

Roland Berger Strategy Consultants cannot attribute this data to any specific person as a general rule (unless you log in). We do not combine this data with data from any other sources.

We statistically analyze this data constantly so we can keep our websites optimized at all times.

## 3.2 Some information you provide

We record and process information you enter on our websites or send us otherwise. This includes data you enter in forms or contact fields, or select from lists or menus.

There are some points in our websites where you can send us information by uploading documents via those websites to our servers. That is what happens when you apply online, for example.

We also record and process personal information when you e-mail someone at Roland Berger. This concerns the contents of your e-mails as such, but also data obtained from queries to our e-mail server, such as sender and addressee IDs, time stamp, errors or grounds for refusal if mail doesn't get through.

## 3.2.1 Profile and login information for access-protected areas

There are some access-restricted areas of the website for which you need to register before you can use them, like the recruiting and alumni areas in particular. When registering, there are some details you have to enter that the registration form itself requires, particularly your e-mail address, a password, and some information about yourself. Any other details you enter are voluntary. We process and save this data.

In some areas of our websites, like our alumni network in particular, some of your registration data or contributions you make can be seen by other users once they log in. It's up to you to decide whether you want other registered users of this site to see your information and, if so, what. You can change these settings at any time.

## 3.2.2 Newsletters and information services

There are many points on Roland Berger Strategy Consultants' websites where we offer newsletters or comparable information services. If you'd like to use these, we'll need a working e-mail address for you and details to enable us to verify that this e-mail address is really yours, or that the person whose address it is agrees to receive the newsletter. That's the only information we gather.

You can withdraw your consent to your data and e-mail address being recorded and used to send newsletters at any time.

## 3.2.3 Other matters

We will never record any of your personal details otherwise without your ex-press consent.

## 4\. Who do we send data to?

## 4.1 Where does data go once it reaches Roland Berger Strategy Consultants?

Once you send data, or it is collected on our websites, we transmit it within Roland Berger Strategy Consultants to the recipients that need to know it. Applications, for instance, go to our human resources department and the department for which the position is advertised.

Data can also be accessed in purely technical terms by service providers and contract partners we use to operate our website. They act as our commissioned data processors.

## 4.2 Sending data to third parties

As a fundamental rule, we do not disclose, transfer, sell or otherwise market personal data to third parties, such as other companies or organizations, without your express consent, or as required to meet our contractual obligations between Roland Berger Strategy Consultants and you, the website user, which make it necessary to transfer such data.

## 4.3 Transfer of data to countries outside the EU/EEA

We do not transfer any personal information to anyone in countries outside the EU or EEA, nor do we have any plans to do so, except in the cases below:

  * If you're applying for positions advertised in countries outside the EU/EEA or which are closely connected to our offices in those countries.
  * If you're registering for events organized outside the EU or EEA.
  * In any other cases where data evidently has to be sent to recipients in countries outside the EU/EEA.



We will generally ask you for your consent before transferring data in these cases.

## 5\. How long can we store data before we have to delete it or block it?

The law is quite detailed when it comes to what data we can and must store and for how long. Once these terms expire, we routinely delete this data or block it, following data protection rules.

Where data is not subject to specific terms, we delete it or block it once the reasons we collected it for cease to apply.

## 6\. What are ""cookies"", and how do we use them?

Roland Berger Strategy Consultants' websites use ""cookies"" in different places. These are small text files which are downloaded onto your computer and are saved in your browser. Cookies do not harm your computer, and do not contain viruses. Most cookies we use are ""session cookies"", and are deleted automatically at the end of your visit.

If you'd like to know how your browser uses cookies, or instruct it not to use them or confirm them in each case, you should activate your browser settings accordingly.

## 7\. Your right to know

We'll be happy to tell you, subject to the relevant legal provisions, what personal details we store on you. If there's anything you'd like to know, please get in touch with Roland Berger Strategy Consultants' data protection officer . And please remember, you'll need to prove who you are before we can give you any information.

## 8\. Security

The security of your data is important to us: so all the areas of our website where you can actively input data use encryption systems such as SSL (Secure Socket Layer) to protect your data against being accessed by unauthorized third parties.

If you register to use access-protected areas of Roland Berger Strategy Consultants' websites, you should keep the login details you receive carefully and protected against access by third parties. If you log in on a computer that is used by more than one person, please don't forget to log off properly at the end of each session and close the browser window you were using.

Roland Berger Strategy Consultants takes extensive technical and organizational security precautions to protect your personal data against being manipulated, either accidentally or deliberately, or being lost, destroyed or accessed by unauthorized third parties. We are constantly improving these precautions as technology develops.

We will NEVER sell or give your information to anyone else or add you to our mailing list simply because you’ve written or ordered.

#### Our commitment to privacy

We respect your privacy. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point where personally identifiable information may be requested.

#### The information we collect &amp; how we use it:

In order to process your order, we may require various forms of personal information from you depending on the payment method you choose. We will never ask for more than is necessary for the bank to verify your ability to pay with your chosen method.

IP addresses are recorded for security purposes only in the check out process.

If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with the user.

We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order.

#### Cookies

A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. Once the user closes their browser, the cookie simply terminates. If your computer is set not to accept cookies, you will not be able to add more than one item to the cart.

Most websites routinely do this and we never share any of this information with anyone who is not directly involved with the maintenance of our website.

#### Our commitment to data security

This website takes precautions to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line.When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and CVV), that information is encrypted and is protected with SSL encryption software. While on a secure page (such as our order form), the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer appears locked, instead of unlocked/open as when you are just ""surfing"". While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also protect user information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information.

The servers that store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure, locked environment.

If you have any questions or concerns about the security of our website or our privacy policies, you are always welcome to send us an email.

#### The information we collect and how we use it:

In processing your order, we may require various forms of personal information from you, depending on the payment method you choose. We will never ask for more information than is necessary for the bank to verify your payment. If we have trouble processing your order, the contact information you provided is used to get in touch with you. We do not share that information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete your order.

IP addresses are recorded for security purposes only during the checkout process.

On some pages, you can submit feedback or leave comments; we may ask you for some additional information so we can better address an issue, but you are never required to leave additional information, and we will never send you unsolicited emails. The only times you will get email from us are if you place an order, ask a question, or subscribe to our newsletter.

We use non-identifying and computer-generated information for statistical purposes only. This includes, among other things, domain, country, browser, platform, and pages visited. Most websites routinely do this, and we never share any of this information with anyone who is not directly involved with the maintenance of our website.

Cookies

A cookie is a piece of data containing information about a user; that data is stored on the user’s hard drive. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. If your computer is set to not accept cookies, you will not be able to add more than one item to your cart.

#### Our commitment to data security

We proudly take every precaution to protect our customers’ privacy and security. When the checkout process asks you to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and CCV), that information is protected with SSL encryption software. While on a secure page (such as the checkout screens), the padlock icon on web browsers such as Firefox or Microsoft Internet Explorer appears locked, instead of unlocked/open as during normal internet use. All of our customers’ data is restricted within our offices; only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our financial manager or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The servers that store sensitive material are kept in a secure, locked environment.

If you have any questions or concerns about the security of our website or our privacy policies, you are always welcome to send us an email.

Cookies

Our site uses “cookies” which are small data files stored on your computer's hard drive or mobile device when you visit a site. Cookies may be used in a variety of ways which enhance and personalize your online browsing and shopping experience. For instance, cookies allow us to remember what's in your shopping cart, recognize you when you return to our site, track your orders, and monitor and maintain information about your visits. You may set your browser not to accept cookies or to notify you when you receive cookies. If you do not accept cookies however, you will not be able to access your account information or make purchases online.

We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. Session ID cookies make it easier for you to navigate our Sites. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser where as a persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s ""help"" file. If you reject cookies, you may still use our Sites, but your ability to use some areas of our Sites, such as surveys, will be limited.

Please note that, similar to Log Files, the use of cookies does not typically result in the disclosure of personal information. Rather, the information collected is non personal in nature and often includes items such as your IP address, internet domain, web browser and operating system.

Log Files

As is true of most websites, we gather certain non Personal Information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and click stream data. We link this automatically-collected data to Personal Information. We use a third-party tracking service that tracks non-Personal Information about visitors to our Sites in the aggregate. We may use this information to analyze trends, to administer our Sites, to track users’ movements around our Sites and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.

Tracking Pixels

We also employ a software technology called clear gifs, that help us better manage content on our Sites by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ Personal Information.

We may use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.

Third Party Ads

We use a third party provider to place our internet ads. The provider may collect anonymous information about your visits to our site and your interaction with our products and services. The provider may also use information about your visits to this and other sites to target advertisements for merchandise and services. This anonymous information is collected through the use of a pixel tag which is industry standard technology used by most major websites. No personally identifiable information is collected or used in this process. The provider does not know your name, address, phone number, email address or any of your other personally identifiable information. If you would like more information about this practice and your option to not have this anonymous information used by our third party provider, click here . To opt-out of Google Display Network ads click on this link.

Bulletin Boards/Chat Rooms

If you use a bulletin board or chat room on our Sites, you should be aware that, by their nature, any Personal Information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. You have full control and discretion as to the information you choose to submit on these portions of our Sites. We are not responsible for the Personal Information you choose to submit in these forums.

Security

We use various technologies and processes to protect your information. Information such as your credit or debit card account number is transmitted through a secure server using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption technology. Note however that absolute security can never be guaranteed. We will never request your credit card or other personal information by email. If you receive an email that appears to be a request from us for personal information, do not respond as this may be a “phishing” scam designed to steal your information. Never include your credit or debit card number or other sensitive information in an email as it is not a secure means of transmitting information. We will only request such information during secure transactions at our site. It is your responsibility to safeguard any password you create to access “My Account” and to sign-out when your visit is complete.

Links To Other Websites

Our site may contain links to sites owned by third parties. Please review the privacy policy of any site you access through our site as we are not responsible for a third party’s privacy policy or practices.

We link this automatically-collected data to Personal Information. We use a third-party tracking service that tracks non-Personal Information about visitors to our Sites in the aggregate. We may use this information to analyze trends, to administer our Sites, to track users' movements around our Sites and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.

TRACKING PIXELS

We also employ a software technology called clear gifs, that help us better manage content on our Sites by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers' Personal Information.

We may use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.

THIRD PARTY ADS

We use a third party provider to place our internet ads. The provider may collect anonymous information about your visits to our site and your interaction with our products and services. The provider may also use information about your visits to this and other sites to target advertisements for merchandise and services. This anonymous information is collected through the use of a pixel tag which is industry standard technology used by most major websites. No personally identifiable information is collected or used in this process. The provider does not know your name, address, phone number, email address or any of your other personally identifiable information.

BULLETIN BOARDS/CHAT ROOMS/BLOGS

If you use a bulletin board, chat room or blog on our Sites, you should be aware that, by their nature, any Personal Information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. You have full control and discretion as to the information you choose to submit on these portions of our Sites. We are not responsible for the Personal Information you choose to submit in these forums.

SECURITY

We use various technologies and processes to protect your information. Information such as your credit or debit card account number is transmitted through a secure server using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption technology. Note however that absolute security can never be guaranteed. We will never request your credit card or other personal information by email. If you receive an email that appears to be a request from us for personal information, do not respond as this may be a ""phishing"" scam designed to steal your information. Never include your credit or debit card number or other sensitive information in an email as it is not a secure means of transmitting information. We will only request such information during secure transactions at our site.

LINKS TO OTHER WEBSITES

Our site may contain links to sites owned by third parties. Please review the privacy policy of any site you access through our site as we are not responsible for a third party's privacy policy or practices.

CHILDREN'S PRIVACY

Our site is not intended for use by children and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. The child's parent or guardian should contact us if we have inadvertently collected such personal information and we will delete it from our files.

INTERNATIONAL USERS

If you are located outside of the United States, please note that this site is hosted on our computer servers in the United States. Your use of this site or submission of personal information will constitute your consent to the transfer of personal information outside of your home country. We abide by the safe harbor framework set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information collected from the European Union.

NOTICE FOR CANADIAN RESIDENTS

You may refuse to provide your consent permitting us to use, obtain or disclose your Personal Information for any purpose by refusing to provide that information to us. You may also withdraw your consent at any time, subject to any legal or contractual restrictions. We will accommodate your request within a reasonable time but such accommodation may limit our ability to effectively serve you. However, if you have any questions or concerns about our privacy practices, please contact our customer service representatives as provided for herein. Unless otherwise indicated by you, we will assume that we have your consent to collect, use and distribute your Personal Information for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy. Upon request and subject to a reasonable fee, we will provide you with access to your information which we have collected. For a copy of The Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act or to contact the Privacy Commissioner of Canada, please visit the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada at www.privcom.gc.ca.

POLICY CHANGES

If our Privacy Policy changes, we will post the changes to our site with the date of revision. Your continued use of our site will constitute your agreement with our revised Privacy Policy. Please also note that our Privacy Policy is incorporated into our site's Terms of Use.

UPDATING AND MODIFYING YOUR COMMUNICATION PREFERENCES

If you wish to update your information or do not wish to be contacted via email, direct mail and/or telephone, please contact Customer Service. Provide your exact name and postal or email address so that we may identify you accurately. You may also ""unsubscribe"" from our email by using the link provided at the bottom of each email. If you ask us to remove you from marketing lists, we will maintain you on a ""do not contact"" list to ensure that we continue to honor your request. It may take up to 10 days to process your ""do not email"" request. It may take up to 8 weeks to process your ""do not mail"" request because mailings are planned long in advance. If you purchase online, we will continue to confirm your order and shipment status via email, postal address or telephone.

The Extraordinaries Privacy Policy  
\-------------------------------------------------------------\----------------------------------------------  
October 20, 2009

The Extraordinaries, Inc. (“The Extraordinaries”) provides this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information we receive from users of www.sparked.com (the “Site”) and our related interactive microvolunteering and crowd sourcing platform (including but not limited to our iPhone and iPod Touch application) (the “Platform”) and when you use a hosted application provided by an Extraordinaries Subscriber (defined below) via our Platform (“Hosted Application”) (any and all of the foregoing, the “Services”). This Privacy Policy applies only to information that you provide to us through the Services (including that which we may collect on your behalf) when you use the Services. 

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time.  We will notify you of any material changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the Site.  You are advised to consult this policy regularly for any changes. 

As used in this policy, the terms “using” and “processing” information include using cookies on a computer, subjecting the information to statistical or other analysis and using or handling information in any way, including, but not limited to collecting, storing, evaluating, modifying, deleting, using, combining, disclosing and transferring information within our organization or among our affiliates within the United States or internationally. 

Information Collection and Use

Personally Identifiable Information. 

o    In the course of using the Services (including a Hosted Application), we may ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you and administer your account (“Personal Information”).  Personal Information includes, but is not limited to, your name, phone number, credit card or other billing information, email address and home and business postal addresses.  We use your Personal Information mainly to provide the Services and administer your inquiries. 

o    We also collect the other information that you provide as part of registration and the administration and personalization of your profile webpage (e.g., without limitation, zip code (on its own) and individual preferences) (“Non-Identifying Information”).

o    We use your Personal Information (in some cases, in conjunction with your Non-Identifying Information) mainly to provide the Services, complete your transactions, and administer your inquiries.  

o    Certain Non-Identifying Information would be considered a part of your Personal Information if it were combined with other identifiers (for example, combining your zip code with your street address) in a way that enables you to be identified.  But the same pieces of information are considered Non-Identifying Information when they are taken alone or combined only with other non-identifying information (for example, your viewing preferences).  We may combine your Personal Information with Non-Identifying Information and aggregate it with information collected from other Extraordinaries users to attempt to provide you with a better experience, to improve the quality and value of the Services and to analyze and understand how our Site and Services are used. We may also use the combined information without aggregating it to serve you specifically, for instance to deliver a product to you according to your preferences or restrictions.

o    We also use your Personal Information to contact you with The Extraordinaries newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information that may be of interest to you.  If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications or update your “user preferences” information. (See “Changing or Deleting Information,” below.)

o    Extraordinaries does not sell, rent, lease or disclose your Personal Information. Except as described in this Privacy Policy, your Personal Information will be used only by Extraordinaries and its controlled subsidiaries and affiliates, and your Personal Information will not be disclosed to any other third party without your consent.

o    Extraordinaries will store personal data until account deletion is requested. At that point, personal data will be scheudled for deletion. Some data may not be deleteable, such as activity listings in public activity feeds. These feeds contain a minimum of personal data (First name and Last Initial only). 

Log Data.  When you use the Services, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website or online service (“Log Data”).  This Log Data may include information such as your computer’s Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type or the webpage you were visiting before you came to our Site, pages of our Site that you visit, the time spent on those pages, information you search for on our Site, access times and dates, and other statistics.  We use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Site and the Services and for the Site’s technical administration, to increase our Site’s functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor it to our visitors’ needs.  For example, some of this information is collected so that when you visit the Site again, it will recognize you and serve advertisements and other information appropriate to your interests.  We also use this information to verify that visitors to the Site meet the criteria required to process their requests. 

Cookies

Like many websites, we use “cookies” to collect information.  A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes.  We use cookies for two purposes.  First, we utilize persistent cookies to save your registration ID and login password for future logins to the Site.  Second, we utilize session ID cookies to enable certain features of the Site, to better understand how you interact with the Site and to monitor aggregate usage by Extraordinaries users and web traffic routing on the Site.  Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted from your computer when you log off from the Site and Services and then close your browser.  Third party advertisers on the Site or Services may also place or read cookies on your browser.  You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit.  If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Site or all functionality of the Services. 

Information Collected on Behalf of and Shared with Our Users 

As used in this Privacy Policy, “Usage Data” means the tracking and usage data generated by Volunteer Users and collected by The Extraordinaries in connection with the Services, including an Volunteer User’s personally identifiable information; and “Volunteer User” means a visitor to or user of a  Hosted Application. 

Hosted Applications. 

o    When you deploy a Hosted Application, as your agent and on your behalf we may collect Usage Data provided by Volunteer Users of a Hosted Application which will contain the personally identifiable information of such Volunteer User.

o    If you are an Volunteer User of  a Hosted Application, the terms of this Privacy Policy govern the use and disclosure of your personally identifiable information in our capacity as a third party service provider to the entity or individual on whose behalf The Extraordinaries collected such information (“Extraordinaries Subscriber”).  We will share this information with the relevant Extraordinaries Subscriber pursuant to your request to interact, follow and/or participate in the Extraordinaries Subscriber’s service via its Hosted Application.  

Emailing Via an Extraordinaries  Account  
As part of the Services, registered users may communicate with registered and non-registered users through use of their accounts.  Where a registered user has selected the option of adding one or more email addresses to an online form, the message they create in the corresponding template will be sent from The Extraordinaries to those email addresses on their behalf. 

Phishing  
Identity theft and the practice currently known as “phishing” are of great concern to Extraordinaries.  Safeguarding information to help protect you from identity theft is a top priority.  We do not and will not, at any time, request your credit card information, your account ID, login password, or national identification numbers in a non-secure or unsolicited e-mail or telephone communication.  For more information about phishing, visit the Federal Trade Commission’s website.

Information Sharing and Disclosure

Extraordinaries Users.  In addition to your username, we will display your Personal Information in your profile page and elsewhere on the Site or via the Services according to the preferences you set in your account. In addition, any comments or submissions that you post to the Site or via Services may be publicly available. For example, if you are using the social community networking features of our Services the information you publish will be viewable by other users.  Any information you choose to provide should reflect how much you want other users to know about you.  We recommend that you guard your anonymity and sensitive information and we encourage Extraordinaries users to think carefully about what information about themselves they disclose in their comments or submissions. 

Volunteer User Information. Depending on the functionality chosen by an Extraordinaries Subscriber,  we may share Volunteer User information with that party. 

Aggregate Information and Non-Identifying Information.   We may share aggregated information that includes your Personal Information, Non-Identifying Information and Log Data with third parties for industry analysis and demographic profiling and to deliver targeted advertising about other products and services.

Service Providers.  We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our Services, to provide the Services on our behalf, to perform Site-related services (e.g., without limitation, maintenance services, database management, web analytics and improvement of the Site’s features) or to assist us in analyzing how our Site and Services are used.  These third parties have access to your Personal Information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose. We may also provide Personal Information to our business partners or other trusted entities for the purpose of providing you with information on goods or services we believe will be of interest to you.  You can, at any time, opt out of receiving such communications.

Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement.  The Extraordinaries will cooperate with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law.  We will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of  The Extraordinaries or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, any illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity. 

Business Transfers.  The Extraordinaries may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets, including your Personal Information, in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in the event of bankruptcy. The Extraordinaries will notify you before transferring your information to a new entity as part of a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of some or all of its assets if the new entity's processing of your information will materially differ from that set forth in this Privacy Policy. 

Changing or Deleting Your Information

All registered users may review, update, correct or delete the Personal Information in their registration profile by contacting us.  If you completely delete all such information, then your account may become deactivated.  If you would like us to delete your record in our system, please contact us at privacy at beextra dot org with a request that we delete your Personal Information from our database. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to honor your request.  We may retain an archived copy of your records as required by law or for legitimate business purposes.

Security 

The Extraordinaries are very concerned with safeguarding your information. We employ certain physical, technological, and administrative security measures, but they may not be reasonable or applicable under the circumstances and, in any case, no security measures can be guaranteed to protect your data.

We will make any legally required disclosures of any  breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored “personal data” (as defined in applicable state statutes on security breach notification) to you via email or conspicuous posting on this Site in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, insofar as consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.

International Transfer

Your information may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction.  If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to us, The Extraordinaries transfers Personal Information to the United States and processes it there.  Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.

Links to Other Sites

Our Services contains links to other websites.  If you choose to visit an advertiser by “clicking on” a banner ad or other type of advertisement, or click on another third party link, you will be directed to that third party’s website.  The fact that we link to a website or present a banner ad or other type of advertisement is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices.  We do not exercise control over third party websites.  These other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you.  Other sites follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them.  We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites you visit. 

Our Policy Toward Children

The Site and Services are not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13.   If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with Personal Information without their consent, he or she should contact us at privacy at beextra dot org.  If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with Personal Information, we will delete such information from our files.

The Extraordinaries complies with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries.

  * In order to process your subscription to use the Services, we will also ask you to provide us with credit card information and/or other billing information (“Billing Information”, and collectively with the Contact Information, the “Personal Information”).
  * We also collect the other information that you provide as part of registration and the administration and personalization of your profile webpage (e.g., without limitation, zip code (on its own) and individual preferences) (“Non-Identifying Information”).


  * Certain features of the Services may allow you to analyze the behavior of your customers (“Customers”). To use such features, you will need to provide certain information regarding your Customers, which may include, but not limited to, the following (collectively, the “Customers Information”): (i) Contact Information, (ii) CRM data, (iii) customer service data, (iv) social networking data, (v) information sent by a browser (“Log Data”), and (vi) API keys or other login information so we can access third party services on your behalf to enhance the Services.


  * We use your Personal Information (in some cases, in conjunction with your Non-Identifying Information) only to provide the Services, complete your transactions, and administer your inquiries.


  * Certain Non-Identifying Information would be considered a part of your Personal Information if it were combined with other identifiers (for example, combining your zip code with your street address) in a way that enables you to be identified. But the same pieces of information are considered Non-Identifying Information when they are taken alone or combined only with other non-identifying information (for example, your viewing preferences). We may combine your Personal Information with Non-Identifying Information and aggregate it with information collected from other Extraordinaries users to attempt to provide you with a better experience, to improve the quality and value of the Services and to analyze and understand how our Site and Services are used.


  * We may also use your Personal Information to contact you with Sparked newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information that may be of interest to you. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications or update your “user preferences” information. (See “Changing or Deleting Information” below.)


  * We store and use Customer Information to perform the services requested by you, including, but not limited to, providing the Services.



Log Data

When you use the Services, our servers automatically record your Log Data. This Log Data may include information such as your computer’s Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type or the webpage you were visiting before you came to our Site, pages of our Site that you visit, the time spent on those pages, information you search for on our Site, access times and dates, and other statistics. We use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Site and the Services and for the Site’s technical administration, to increase our Site’s functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor it to your needs. We also use this information to verify that visitors to the Site meet the criteria required to process their requests.

Cookies

Like many websites, we use “cookies” to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies for two purposes. First, we utilize persistent cookies to save your registration ID and login password for future logins to the Site. Second, we utilize session ID cookies to enable certain features of the Site, to better understand how you interact with the Site and to monitor aggregate usage by Extraordinaries users and web traffic routing on the Site. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted from your computer when you log off from the Site and Services and then close your browser. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Site or all functionality of the Services.

Hosted Applications

  * When you deploy a Hosted Application or contact your Customers through the Services (such as a survey), as your agent and on your behalf we may collect Usage Data provided by Customers, which will contain the personally identifiable information of such Customers.


  * If you are a Customer using a Hosted Application or responding to a survey or similar request from us or the Client through the Services, the terms of this Privacy Policy govern the use and disclosure of your personally identifiable information in our capacity as a third party service provider to the entity or individual on whose behalf Sparked collected such information (“Sparked Client”). We will share this information with the relevant Sparked Client pursuant to your request to interact, follow and/or participate in Sparked Client’s service.



Emailing

Where a Client has selected the option of sending email messages to a group of their Customers, the message they create in the corresponding template will be sent from Sparked to those email addresses on their behalf.

Information Sharing and Disclosure

We will not share your Personal Information, Customer Data, nor an Confidential Information with any third party without your express written consent.

Service Providers

We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our Services, to provide the Services on our behalf, to perform Site-related services (e.g., without limitation, maintenance services, database management, web analytics and improvement of the Site’s features) or to assist us in analyzing how our Site and Services are used. These third parties have access to your Personal Information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.

Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement 

Sparked remains committed to respecting your privacy. We will disclose information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties only (a) pursuant to a court order or court-ordered warrant, or a subpoena or summons issued by a judicial officer; or (b) when we, in our reasonable discretion, believe it is necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of Sparked or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, any illegal or legally actionable activity, with prior written notice to you.

Business Transfers

Sparked may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets, including your Personal Information, in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in the event of bankruptcy. Sparked will notify you before transferring your information to a new entity as part of a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of some or all of its assets if the new entity’s processing of your information will materially differ from that set forth in this Privacy Policy.

Changing or Deleting Your Information

All registered users may review, update, correct or delete the Personal Information in their registration profile by contacting us. If you completely delete all such information, then your account may become deactivated. If you would like us to delete your record in our system, please contact us at privacy@sparked.com with a request that we delete your Personal Information from our database. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to honor your request. We may retain an archived copy of your records as required by law or for legitimate business purposes.

Security 

We are very concerned with safeguarding your information. Identity theft and other security risks are of great concern to Sparked. Safeguarding information to help protect you from identity theft is a top priority. We do not and will not, at any time, request your credit card information, your account ID, login password, or national identification numbers in a non-secure or unsolicited e-mail or telephone communication.  Additional information about our security can be found at Security.

We employ certain physical, technological, and administrative security measures. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) through the Services, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We will make any legally required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored “personal data” (as defined in applicable state statutes on security breach notification) to you via email or conspicuous posting on this Site in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, insofar as consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system. While we strive to use commercially reasonable means to protect your Personal Information, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can contact us at support@sparked.com. Please visit http://hello.sparked.com/security/ for more information on our security measures.

International Transfer

Your information may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to us, Sparked transfers Personal Information to the United States and processes it there. Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.

Links to Other Sites

Our Services contains links to other websites. The fact that we link to a website is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices. We do not exercise control over third party websites. These other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. Other sites follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites you visit.

Our Policy Toward Children

The Site and Services are not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with Personal Information without their consent, he or she should contact us at privacy at beextra dot org. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with Personal Information, we will delete such information from our files.

Safe Harbor

The Extraordinaries complies with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries. The Extraordinaries has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement.

(""Ross,"" ""we,"" ""us"") is concerned about online privacy issues and wants you to be familiar with how we collect, use and disclose your Personally Identifiable Information (as defined below). This Privacy Policy (the ""Policy"") describes our practices in connection with Personally Identifiable Information that we collect through our web site located at  https://www.rossstores.com/ (the ""Site""). This Policy does not address our practices regarding information that we collect through any web site, or by any other means, other than through the Site; nor does this Policy govern the collection, use or disclosure of information by any of our affiliates (collectively, ""Affiliated Entities"") or by third parties.

By using the Site, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Policy. If you do not agree to the terms and conditions of this Policy, please do not use the Site. We reserve the right to change this Policy without prior notice. You can determine when this Policy was last revised by referring to the ""LAST UPDATED"" legend at the top of this page. Any changes to our Policy will become effective upon our posting of the revised Policy on the Site.

Note Regarding the Use of the Site by Children: The Site is not directed to individuals under the age of fourteen (14), and we request that such individuals do not provide Personally Identifiable Information through the Site.

  1. What Types of Information Does Ross Collect From Me?.




Ross gathers two basic types of information through the Site: ""Personally Identifiable Information"" (or ""PII"") and ""Non-Personally Identifiable Information"" (or ""Non-PII""). Personally Identifiable Information is information that identifies you as an individual, or relates to an identifiable person, including: name, postal address, telephone number, email address, and credit or debit card number. Non-Personally Identifiable Information is aggregated information, demographic information, IP addresses and any other information that does not reveal your specific identity, or does not directly relate to an individual.

  1. Personally Identifiable Information. You do not have to provide PII to use the Site. However, in order for you to take advantage of particular opportunities provided through the Site (for example, to register for e-mail, to submit a job application or ask a question), we may require that you furnish PII. We collect PII from you through the Site, such as your name, postal address, telephone number or e-mail address, only when you voluntarily provide it to us.

  2. We use a third-party payment service (""Payment Service"") to collect payments made through the Site when purchasing a Ross gift card online. If you wish to purchase a gift card through the Site, you will be directed to a webpage that is hosted by the Payment Service (or the Payment Service’s service providers) and not by Ross (the ""Payment Service Page""). Any PII that you provide through the Payment Service Page will be collected by Payment Service and not by Ross, and will be subject to Payment Service's privacy policy, rather than this Policy. Ross has no control over, and shall not be responsible for, Payment Service’s use of information collected through the Payment Service Page. PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS POLICY DOES NOT ADDRESS THE COLLECTION AND USE OF INFORMATION THROUGH THE PAYMENT SERVICE PAGE OR THE PRIVACY OR INFORMATION PRACTICES OF PAYMENT SERVICE.

  3. Non-Personally Identifiable Information. When you visit and interact with the Site, Ross and its third-party service providers may collect Non-PII (for example, a catalog of the Site pages you visit). Non-PII is generally collected through the Site from five different sources: (i) server log files, (ii) environmental variables, (iii) cookies, (iv) pixel tags and other similar technologies, and (v) information that you voluntarily provide to us.

  4. Server Log Files. Your Internet Protocol (IP) address is a number that is automatically assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet Service Provider (ISP). This number is identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever you visit the Site, along with the time(s) of your visit(s) and the page(s) that you visited. We and our service providers use IP addresses for purposes such as calculating Site usage levels, helping diagnose problems with the Site's servers, and administering the Site. Collecting IP addresses is standard practice on the Internet and is done automatically by many web sites.

  5. Environmental Variables. We and our service providers may also collect certain environmental variables, such as your computer type (Windows or Macintosh), screen resolution, OS version, Internet browser, and Internet browser version. These environmental variables are collected by most browsers, and can be used to optimize your experience on the Site.

  6. Cookies. We and our service providers may use “cookies” in connection with the Site. Cookies are data that a web server transfers to an individual's computer for recordkeeping and other purposes. Cookies are an industry standard used by most web sites, and can facilitate users' ongoing access to and use of a particular web site; cookies do not cause damage to your computer systems or files. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to automatically decline cookies, or to be given the choice of declining or accepting the transfer of a particular cookie, or cookies from a particular web site, to your computer.  We use Google Analytics, which uses cookies and other, similar technologies to collect information about site use anonymously and reports website trends, without identifying individual visitors. You can learn about Google’s practices by going to  www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/, and opt out of them by downloading the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on, available at  https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.

  7. Pixel Tags. We and our service providers may also use so-called ""pixel tags,"" ""web beacons,"" ""clear GIFs,"" or similar means in connection with Site pages and HTML-formatted e-mail messages to, among other things, track the actions of Site users and e-mail recipients, to determine the success of marketing campaigns and to compile aggregate statistics about Site usage and response rates.

  8. Information That You Voluntarily Provide. Ross also collects Non-PII (e.g., your interests, your geographic location, etc.) when you voluntarily provide such information to us. Such information constitutes Non-PII because, unless combined with PII, it does not personally identify you or any other user. Additionally, we may aggregate PII in a manner such that the end-product does not personally identify you or any other user of the Site, for example, by using PII to calculate the percentage of our users who have a particular telephone area code. Such aggregate information is considered Non-PII for purposes of this Policy.




How Does Ross Use Information Collected From Me?

Personally Identifiable Information. We may use PII about you in the following ways:

Fulfillment of Requests. Ross may use PII about you to fulfill the purpose for which such PII was provided (e.g., to send newsletters to you or respond to your inquiries).

  1. Administrative Communications. From time to time, in our sole discretion, we may use PII about you to send to you important information regarding the Site, changes to our terms, conditions, and policies or other administrative information. Because this information may be important to your use of the Site, you may not opt-out of receiving such communications.

  2. Other Communications. From time to time, we may use PII about you to inform you of products, programs, services and promotions that we believe may be of interest to you. If you would prefer that we do not send electronic marketing messages to you, please see the ""Opt-Out"" section below.

  3. Promotions. We may operate sweepstakes, contests and similar promotions (collectively, ""Promotions"") through the Site. We typically ask you for certain PII when you enter and, if applicable, win a Promotion. You should carefully review the rules, if any, of each Promotion in which you participate through the Site, as they may contain additional important information about Ross's use of PII about you. To the extent that the terms and conditions of such rules concerning the treatment of PII about you conflict with this Policy, the terms and conditions of such rules shall control.

  4. Internal Business Purposes. We may also use PII about you for our internal business purposes, such as data analysis, audits and so forth.

  5. Non-Personally Identifiable Information.

","Ross Stores, Inc. (""Ross,"" ""we,"" ""us"") is concerned about online privacy issues and wants you to be familiar with how we collect, use and disclose your Personally Identifiable Information (as defined below). This Privacy Policy (the ""Policy"") describes our practices in connection with Personally Identifiable Information that we collect through our web site located at https://www.rossstores.com/ (the ""Site""). This Policy does not address our practices regarding information that we collect through any web site, or by any other means, other than through the Site; nor does this Policy govern the collection, use or disclosure of information by any of our affiliates (collectively, ""Affiliated Entities"") or by third parties. 

By using the Site, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Policy. If you do not agree to the terms and conditions of this Policy, please do not use the Site. We reserve the right to change this Policy without prior notice. You can determine when this Policy was last revised by referring to the ""LAST UPDATED"" legend at the top of this page. Any changes to our Policy will become effective upon our posting of the revised Policy on the Site. Use of the Site following such changes constitutes your acceptance of the revised Policy then in effect.

Note Regarding the Use of the Site by Children: The Site is not directed to individuals under the age of thirteen (13), and we request that such individuals do not provide Personally Identifiable Information through the Site.

### What Types of Information Does Ross Collect From Me?

Ross gathers two basic types of information through the Site: ""Personally Identifiable Information"" (or ""PII"") and ""Non-Personally Identifiable Information"" (or ""Non-PII""). Personally Identifiable Information is information that identifies you as an individual, or relates to an identifiable person, including: name, postal address, telephone number, email address, and credit or debit card number. Non-Personally Identifiable Information is aggregated information, demographic information, IP addresses and any other information that does not reveal your specific identity, or does not directly relate to an individual.

#### Personally Identifiable Information.

You do not have to provide PII to use the Site. However, in order for you to take advantage of particular opportunities provided through the Site (for example, to register for e-mail, to submit a job application or ask a question), we may require that you furnish PII. We collect PII from you through the Site, such as your name, postal address, telephone number or e-mail address, only when you voluntarily provide it to us.

We use a third-party payment service (""Payment Service"") to collect payments made through the Site when purchasing a Ross gift card online.  We also use a third-party service to collect online donations (“Donation Service”).  If you wish to purchase a gift card or make a donation through the Site, you will be directed to a webpage that is hosted by the Payment Service (or the Payment Service’s service providers), or the Donation Service, and not by Ross (the ""Payment Service Page"" or the “Donation Service Page”). Any PII that you provide through the Payment Service Page or the Donation Service Page will be collected by the Payment Service or the Donation Service, and not by Ross, and will be subject to Payment Service's or Donation Service’s privacy policy, rather than this Policy. Ross has no control over, and shall not be responsible for, Payment Service’s or Donation Service’s use of information collected through the Payment Service Page or the Donation Service Page. PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS POLICY DOES NOT ADDRESS THE COLLECTION AND USE OF INFORMATION THROUGH THE PAYMENT SERVICE PAGE OR THE DONATION SERVICE PAGE, OR THE PRIVACY OR INFORMATION PRACTICES OF PAYMENT SERVICE OR DONATION SERVICE.

#### Non-Personally Identifiable Information

When you visit and interact with the Site, Ross and its third-party service providers may collect Non-PII (for example, a catalog of the Site pages you visit). Non-PII is generally collected through the Site from five different sources:

  1. server log files,
  2. environmental variables,
  3. cookies,
  4. pixel tags and other similar technologies, and
  5. information that you voluntarily provide to us.



#### Server Log Files.

Your Internet Protocol (IP) address is a number that is automatically assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet Service Provider (ISP). This number is identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever you visit the Site, along with the time(s) of your visit(s) and the page(s) that you visited. We and our service providers use IP addresses for purposes such as calculating Site usage levels, helping diagnose problems with the Site's servers, and administering the Site. Collecting IP addresses is standard practice on the Internet and is done automatically by many web sites. We may also derive your approximate location from your IP address.

#### Environmental Variables.

We and our service providers may also collect certain environmental variables, such as your computer type (Windows or Macintosh), screen resolution, OS version, Internet browser, and Internet browser version. These environmental variables are collected by most browsers, and can be used to optimize your experience on the Site.

#### Cookies.

We and our service providers may use “cookies” in connection with the Site. Cookies are data that a web server transfers to an individual's computer for recordkeeping and other purposes, including to facilitate users’ ongoing access to and use of a particular web site, as well as to understand how the site is used. Cookies are an industry standard used by most web sites; cookies do not cause damage to your computer systems or files. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to automatically decline cookies, or to be given the choice of declining or accepting the transfer of a particular cookie, or cookies from a particular web site, to your computer. We use Google Analytics, which uses cookies and other, similar technologies to collect and analyze information about Site use and report on activities and trends. This service may also collect information regarding the use of other websites. You can learn about Google’s practices by going to www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/, and opt out of them by downloading the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on, available at https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout. At this time we do not respond to browser do-not-track signals.

#### Pixel Tags.

We and our service providers may also use so-called ""pixel tags,"" ""web beacons,"" ""clear GIFs,"" or similar means in connection with Site pages and HTML-formatted e-mail messages to, among other things, track the actions of Site users and e-mail recipients, to determine the success of marketing campaigns and to compile aggregate statistics about Site usage and response rates.

#### Interest Based Advertising.

We may use third-party advertising companies to serve advertisements regarding goods and services that may be of interest to you when you access and use our Site and other websites, apps or online services, based on information relating to your access and use of our Site and other websites, apps and services on any of your devices, as well as information received from third parties. To do so, these companies may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser (including through the use of pixel tags). They may also use these technologies, along with information they collect about your online use, to recognize you across the devices you use, such as a mobile phone and a laptop. If you would like more information about this practice, and to learn how to opt out of it in desktop and mobile browsers on the particular device on which you are accessing this Privacy Policy, please visit http://networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp and http://www.aboutads.info/choices/. You may download the AppChoices app at www.aboutads.info/appchoices to opt out in mobile apps.

#### Information That You Voluntarily Provide.

Ross also collects Non-PII (e.g., your interests, your geographic location, etc.) when you voluntarily provide such information to us. Such information constitutes Non-PII because, unless combined with PII, it does not personally identify you or any other user. Additionally, we may aggregate PII in a manner such that the end-product does not personally identify you or any other user of the Site, for example, by using PII to calculate the percentage of our users who have a particular telephone area code. Such aggregate information is considered Non-PII for purposes of this Policy.

### How Does Ross Use Information Collected From Me?

  


#### Personally Identifiable Information.

We may use PII about you in the following ways:

#### Fulfillment of Requests.

Ross may use PII about you to fulfill the purpose for which such PII was provided (e.g., to send newsletters to you or respond to your inquiries).

#### Administrative Communications.

From time to time, in our sole discretion, we may use PII about you to send to you important information regarding the Site, changes to our terms, conditions, and policies or other administrative information. Because this information may be important to your use of the Site, you may not opt-out of receiving such communications.

#### Other Communications.

From time to time, we may use PII about you to inform you of products, programs, services and promotions that we believe may be of interest to you. If you would prefer that we do not send electronic marketing messages to you, please see the ""Opt-Out"" section below.

#### Promotions.

We may operate sweepstakes, contests and similar promotions (collectively, ""Promotions"") through the Site. We typically ask you for certain PII when you enter and, if applicable, win a Promotion. You should carefully review the rules, if any, of each Promotion in which you participate through the Site, as they may contain additional important information about Ross's use of PII about you. To the extent that the terms and conditions of such rules concerning the treatment of PII about you conflict with this Policy, the terms and conditions of such rules shall control.

#### Business Purposes.

We may also use PII about you for our general business purposes including but not limited to data analysis, audits, advertising and so forth.

#### Non-Personally Identifiable Information.

Because Non-PII does not personally identify you, we may use such information for any purpose, except where we are required to do otherwise under applicable law. In addition, we reserve the right to share such Non PII, which does not personally identify you, with Affiliated Entities and other third parties, for any purpose. If we are required to treat Non-PII as PII under applicable law, then we may use and disclose it for the purposes for which we use and disclose PII as detailed in this Privacy Policy.

In some instances, we may combine Non-PII with PII (such as combining your name with your geographic location). If we do combine any Non-PII with PII, the combined information will be treated by us as PII hereunder as long as it is so combined.

### How Is Personally Identifiable Information Disclosed?

  


#### Third Party Service Providers.

We work with third parties who provide services including but not limited to data analysis, web hosting, managing our mailing lists, advertising, order fulfillment and other administrative purposes.

#### Promotions.

We reserve the right to share the PII you provide in connection with Promotions with third party sponsors of such Promotions (irrespective of whether such Promotions are hosted by us), or otherwise in accordance with the rules applicable to such Promotion. You should carefully review the rules, if any, of each Promotion in which you participate through the Site, as they may contain additional important information about a sponsor's or other third parties’ use of PII about you. To the extent that the terms and conditions of such rules concerning the treatment of PII about you conflict with this Policy, the terms and conditions of such rules shall control.

#### Assignment.

We reserve the right to transfer any and all information that we collect from Site users to an Affiliated Entity or a third party in the event of any reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of Ross's business, assets or stock (including without limitation in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings).

#### Law enforcement; emergencies; compliance.

We reserve the right to use and disclose PII about you to others:

  1. as required or permitted under applicable law;
  2. to comply with legal process;
  3. to respond to governmental requests;
  4. to enforce our Terms of Service;
  5. to protect our operations or those of any Affiliated Entities;

In general, you can visit Sony’s websites on the Internet without telling us who you are and without providing any personal data. There are times, however, where not providing the minimum necessary data as indicated in the relevant data entry sections and other pages in the relevant website, may result in Sony’s inability to sell you products and/or provide you with certain services, including after sales services.

Top

### 2\. Why Sony collects personal data

Personal Data means any data related to a person that allows that person to be identified such as your name, age, telephone number, e-mail and mailing address (“Personal Data”).

Sony would like to collect, maintain and use your Personal Data to:

\- fulfil its obligations under any sale and purchase contract and any other contract between you and Sony

\- provide customer care, including services related to Sony businesses, such as warranty and after sales services

\- ask your opinions on Sony products and services and conduct product surveys

### 3\. How Sony collects personal data

Sony collects data about you in several ways. For example, we might ask for your contact information when you correspond with Sony, call Sony to make a purchase or request service, register your purchased product for after sales service, register to participate in an on-line survey or to any promotional offers, chat rooms, or on bulletin boards.

Here are some of the most typical examples of how Sony collects your personal data.

\- When you register a Sony product or service, we will collect your name, address data and the product or model name, etc.

\- When you ask our customer service for help, we will keep a record of your name, the product(s) you bought, the technical issues at hand, and our advice to you etc.

\- When you buy a product from us, or make a request to purchase, we record your name, contact details, the products you want to buy or bought and your requests to us. If you buy online an account will be created with your payment and shipping preferences. A credit check may have to be done if you decide to purchase a product or a service.

\- When you want to participate in online communities, we need to record your account details and preferences. Some of our web sites allow for some personalisation of the content according to your interests, in which case we are recording your preferences.

\- Keeping a record of your contact details and any resulting financial transaction in the context of a repair 

Data collected online may also be combined with data you provide to Sony at other times. For example, during product registrations, calls to our call centers or at public events such as exhibitions and trade shows. The Personal Data provided to Sony in these cases may be consolidated with existing databases and stored, so that our customer data management systems are simplified.

Top

### 4\. Your preferences

The personal data we collect may be stored in different databases. Sony makes every effort to take into account the various preferences you may have expressed over time in order to process your data in a consistent way. If for any reason you receive incorrect data, Sony Customer Service can be contacted to rectify this situation.

Top

### 5\. When Sony discloses personal data

Sony will not disclose Personal Data to third parties (“3Ps”) other than Sony group companies, without your consent, except in the following cases: 

Personal Data may be disclosed to sub-contracting 3Ps to enable the performance of contracts you are party to or for other purposes mentioned in section 4 Sony uses other companies to perform functions on its behalf, such as fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mails, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments and providing customer services. Such companies will have access to personal data needed to perform these functions, but may not use it for any other purpose and are required to process the data in accordance with applicable law.

Personal Data may be disclosed to 3Ps to enable compliance with legal obligations to which Sony is subject. If Personal Data is disclosed to 3Ps to enable them to provide services for, on behalf of, or at the direction of Sony, then Sony takes measures to ensure that the 3Ps comply with our own privacy policy, and that such recipients:

\- do not use the Personal Data for any other purposes than those permitted

\- obtain and process Personal Data only on condition that they protect that Personal Data from unauthorised use and adopt and comply with similarly stringent policies and terms on Personal Data protection and use

\- comply strictly with applicable laws

### 8\. Cookies and web beacons

Certain Sony websites may employ an industry-wide technology called “cookies”. These are small pieces of data that are placed on your hard disk drive when you access a website or a certain part of a website. Cookies help Sony understand which parts of its websites are the most popular, where Sony visitors are going, and how much time they spend there. 

Sony uses cookies to study traffic patterns on its sites in order to improve website performance, to customise the user experience, and to better match the users’ interests and preferences. For example, Sony keeps track of the domains from which people visit, and also measures visitor activity on Sony websites. However, these tracking records are performed and maintained in ways that keep the data non-identifiable.

Cookies may also be used to recognise your computer next time you visit a website. This might save you time (e.g. by ensuring that you don not have to register again) or help you by customising your internet settings.

If you do not wish to accept cookies, they can be disabled by referring to your browser manufacturer’s instructions. Please refer to your browser instructions or help screen to learn more about these functions. For example, in Internet Explorer, you can go to the Tools/Internet options/Security and Privacy Tabs to adapt the browser to your expectations.

Web beacons, also known as single pixel or clear gif technology, or action tags, may be used on our site. This technology show us which visitors clicked on key elements (such as links or graphics) on a Sony Web page or a Sony email. When you ask us to send you information on a promotion or a newsletter, we may use web beacons to establish which emails are actually opened. We use this information in order to optimise our content and services.

These Web beacons usually work in conjunction with cookies. If you don't want your cookie information to be associated with your visits to these pages, you can set your browser to turn off cookies. In Microsoft Outlook 2003 or similar, downloading of pictures can be turned off on a site by site bases.

### 9\. Access to your personal data

You have the right to access your Personal Data, and to rectify or delete inaccuracies in your Personal Data, and to object to the processing of your Personal Data. 

If you would like to view, correct, amend or update your Personal Data stored in Sony’s database, contact Sony at the address given in section 14 below by e-mail, fax, phone or letter. For privacy protection reasons, you will be asked to provide some proof of identification

On demand, you can receive an explanation regarding the processing of your Personal Data and also obtain confirmation that all relevant parties have been notified of your request(s) for information, for alteration or for deletion, as appropriate. Sony will do its best to comply with such requests.

If you would like to unsubscribe from an email sent to you, follow the ‘unsubscribe’ link and/or instructions placed (typically) at the bottom of the mail. If you use more than one e-mail address to shop or contact Sony, unsubscribe from each e-mail account you use.

### 10\. Links to other sites

Some Sony websites may contain links to other websites that are not operated by Sony. Sony does not share your Personal Data with those websites. While Sony tries to link only to sites that share Sony’s high standards and respect for privacy, Sony is not responsible for the content, security, or privacy practices employed by other sites and expressly disclaims all liability associated with your use of such other sites and the content found there.

### 11\. Children’s privacy (children 14 years of age and under)

Sony does not knowingly solicit or collect Personal Data from or about children (aged 14 and under) without the consent of a parent or guardian, and Sony does not knowingly market its products or services to children. If Sony becomes aware that the person submitting Personal Data, through any part of Sony’s websites, is a child, Sony will use reasonable efforts to delete that Personal Data from its files as soon as possible. Sony will also use reasonable efforts to ensure that this Personal Data is not used for any purpose, nor disclosed to any 3P. As Sony does not seek to collect any Personal Data about children, and Sony deletes any data collected inadvertently as soon as it is discovered, Sony retains no data about children that could be reviewed or deleted. If a parent requests review or deletion of data about their child before Sony has discovered and deleted the data, then Sony will of course honour that request.

  * fulfil its obligations under any sale and purchase contract, including checking that the payment is not made fraudulently, delivering your purchase to you or ensuring that you benefit from any relevant special offer or promotion, as well as any other contract with you;
  * provide customer care, including services related to Sony businesses, such as warranty and after sales services;
  * ask your opinions on Sony products and services and conduct product surveys;
  * facilitate and process your searches and requests for information on Sony and its products and services;
  * provide you with the latest Sony products and services information, including upgrades and special offers in which you may be interested;
  * improve Sony products and services for you;
  * conduct prize draws, contests and other promotional offers; and
  * consider employing you if these data are requested on one of Sony’s job application websites.



For these purposes, Sony may share, make available or transmit Personal Data to other Sony group companies within Europe and Sony group companies worldwide, including countries that do not have effective data protection laws and where you may have fewer legal rights in respect of your Personal Data. However, even in such countries, Sony group companies will use your Personal Data only for the purposes outlined above, and they are or will be subject to stringent policies and terms on Personal Data use and protection. (“Sony group companies” are Sony Corporation, and any entity, firm or corporation, the majority of whose shares or equity is owned or controlled directly or indirectly by Sony Corporation).

### 3\. How Sony collects Personal Data

Sony (and where relevant a Sony Centre) collect data about you in several ways. For example, we might ask for your contact information when you correspond with Sony, call Sony to make a purchase or request service, register your purchased product for after sales service, register to participate in an online survey or to any promotional offers, chat rooms, or on bulletin boards.

Here are some of the most typical examples of how Sony (and where relevant a Sony Centre) collects your Personal Data.

  * When you create a MySony profile or register a Sony product or service, we will collect your name, address data and the product or model name, etc;
  * When you purchase a product from us and submit your payment details to us (see section 4 below, for further details); 
  * When you ask our customer service for help, we will keep a record of your name, the product(s) you bought, the technical issues at hand, and our advice to you, etc.
  * When you want to participate in online communities, we need to record your account details and preferences. Some of our web sites allow for some personalisation of the content according to your interests, in which case we are recording your preferences.
  * Keeping a record of your contact details and any resulting financial transaction in the context of a repair



Data collected online may also be combined with data you provide to Sony at other times. For example, during product registrations, calls to our call centres or at public events, such as exhibitions and trade shows. The Personal Data you provide in these cases may be consolidated with existing databases and stored, so that our customer data management systems are simplified.

Personal Data may be disclosed to third parties to enable the performance of contracts you are party to or for other purposes mentioned in section 4 or to ensure that you benefit fully from any relevant special offers and promotions.Sony (and where relevant a Sony Centre) uses other companies to perform functions on its behalf, such as fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mails,sending text messages (SMS),providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments,providing fraud checking services and providing customer services.

### 7\. Postings to Forums

Postings on certain Sony websites (whether in chat rooms, on message boards or via other methods of communication within the Forums) will generally be available to, and freely accessible by, other users of Sony Forums. Therefore, users should not expect any information they post to be kept private or confidential and they are encouraged to exercise discretion when using the Sony Forums. Additionally, your member name will always be posted in conjunction with your posting in the Sony Forums.

Sony will also flag in your My Sony account each time you create or reply to a post or thread on a Sony website forum. These flags are used by Sony to better understand the ‘typical users’ of its forums and to select or tailor Sony’s marketing communications to reflect your forum activity. The flags only log the forum name and the time and date of your post or thread. Sony does not use the content of your forum posts or threads for these purposes.

Sony will use all reasonable efforts to take all appropriate technical and organisational measures and precautions to keep Personal Data it holds about you secure and protected from unauthorised access, use or alteration and unlawful destruction. Measures include using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption when collecting or transferring sensitive data, such as credit card details.

### 9\. Cookies and web beacons

Certain Sony websites may employ an industry-wide technology called “cookies”. These are small pieces of data that are placed on your hard disk drive when you access a website or a certain part of a website. Cookies help Sony understand which parts of its websites are the most popular, where Sony visitors are going, and how much time they spend there.

Sony uses cookies to study traffic patterns on its sites in order to improve website performance, to customise the user experience, and to better match the users’ interests and preferences. For example, Sony keeps track of the domains from which people visit, and also measures visitor activity on Sony websites. However, these tracking records are performed and maintained in ways that keep the data non-identifiable.

Cookies may also be used to recognise your computer next time you visit a website. This might save you time (e.g. by ensuring that you don not have to register again) or help you by customising your internet settings.

If you do not wish to accept cookies, they can be disabled by referring to your browser manufacturer’s instructions. Please refer to your browser instructions or help screen to learn more about these functions. For example, in Internet Explorer, you can go to the Tools/Internet options/Security and Privacy Tabs to adapt the browser to your expectations.

Web beacons, also known as single pixel or clear gif technology, or action tags, may be used on our site. This technology tells us which visitors clicked on key elements (such as links or graphics) on a Sony Web page or a Sony email. When you ask us to send you information on a promotion or a newsletter, we may use web beacons to establish which emails are actually opened. We use this information in order to optimise our content and services.

These Web beacons usually work in conjunction with cookies. If you don't want your cookie information to be associated with your visits to these pages, you can set your browser to turn off cookies. In Microsoft Outlook 2003 or similar, downloading of pictures can be turned off on a site by site basis.

### 10\. Access to your Personal Data

You have the right to access your Personal Data, and to rectify or delete inaccuracies in your Personal Data, and to object to the processing of your Personal Data. 

If you would like to view, correct, amend or update your Personal Data stored in Sony’s database, contact Sony at the address given in section 14 below by e-mail, fax, phone or letter. For privacy protection reasons, you will be asked to provide some proof of identification.

If you would like to unsubscribe from an email sent to you, follow the ‘unsubscribe’ link and/or instructions placed (typically) at the bottom of the mail. If you use more than one e-mail address to shop or contact Sony, unsubscribe from each e-mail account you use.

If you have made a purchase over the website or the telephone, you can view, amend, correct or update your Personal Data held by Sony or the relevant Sony Centre by contacting Sony or that Sony Centre on the details provided with your purchase.

### 11\. Links to other sites

Some Sony websites may contain links to other websites that are not operated by Sony. Sony does not share your Personal Data with those websites (other than as described in section 6). While Sony tries to link only to sites that share Sony’s high standards and respect for privacy, Sony is not responsible for the content, security, or privacy practices employed by other sites and expressly disclaims all liability associated with your use of such other sites and the content found there.

### 12\. Children’s privacy (children 14 years of age and under)

Sony does not knowingly solicit or collect Personal Data from or about children (aged 14 and under) without the consent of a parent or guardian, and Sony does not knowingly market its products or services to children. If Sony becomes aware that the person submitting Personal Data, through any part of Sony’s websites, is a child, Sony will use reasonable efforts to delete that Personal Data from its files as soon as possible. Sony will also use reasonable efforts to ensure that this Personal Data is not used for any purpose, nor disclosed to any third party. As Sony does not seek to collect any Personal Data about children, and Sony deletes any data collected inadvertently as soon as it is discovered, Sony retains no data about children that could be reviewed or deleted. If a parent requests review or deletion of data about their child before Sony has discovered and deleted the data, then Sony will of course honour that request.

We have ensured the privacy and security of your transactions with us. Your credit card information and other data given during the order process will be guarded with the highest levels of security and confidentiality.

### Secure Shopping

The information for all orders placed on our site is encrypted using SSL technology, so your transactions are completely protected. With SSL in place for both the client and the server, the information sent via the internet will arrive via an SSL-enabled browser. Most browsers today are equipped with SSL. To be sure your connection is secure when filling out the order form, simply check for the padlock icon in the address bar your browser window when viewing the order form itself. The icon should be visible and show the lock in the locked position.

Note: Email is not encrypted and is not a secure means of sending credit card information. Please place all orders through the normal checkout process. Do not attempt to email an order.

### Your Privacy Online

SparkFun Electronics respects privacy of Internet Users and does not collect personally identifying information without the Internet User’s permission. We don’t sell any information to anyone. We don’t really have the time or the energy! You can be confident that SparkFun Electronics does not sell or exchange email addresses with third parties.

There may be times when SparkFun is legally compelled to turn over user’s data. If this ever happens, we promise to work with the law enforcement agency to do everything in our power to limit the amount of information released. If you are with a law enforcement agency, please see our Law Enforcement page for more information.

Information provided while placing an order will be handled according to the policy in effect at the time of the order. From time to time we may change our policies, and any such changes will be reflected in these policy statements. Concerned customers should review these statements for changes when revisiting the site.
","SparkFun assumes the following responsibilities:

  1. Protecting all data generated by and provided to us by our users from being stolen, compromised, or used in violation with this policy.
  2. Never selling user-provided and user-generated data for financial gain or competitive advantage.
  3. Providing transparency for our users into what data we collect and what we do with it including what access third parties have to user data and for what purpose.
  4. Informing users if their data is compromised, either by failure to protect data or by order to surrender data to a legal authority, to the fullest extent we are lawfully able.



## What We Know About You

If you register an account with SparkFun, we’ll have access to your e-mail address and any additional contact information you choose to provide us. If you place an order, we retain a record of the contents of the order, delivery and billing address information, and any communication you might have with our customer support team about the order. If you use features such as commenting, in-stock notifications, and comment reply notifications, we retain record of this fact.

If you browse sparkfun.com, with or without a login, we know for a limited time that a user at your IP address has visited pages on the site.

We collect data on what products and content you browse in order to offer better value to you through personalized email, and to see which products/content are the most useful to you.

## When and How We Send Email

We send email to users when orders are placed, paused, shipped, or ready for local pickup. We may be in contact when an order requires payment before shipping or if other issues prevent us from fulfilling an order. We will send you email to verify your email address or if you request a password reset. We may send you email to request reviews of our products or feedback on your experience with our website, products, or customer support.

We will notify users if we believe their privacy has been compromised, if it is within our power to do so. For example, if we discover a customer’s account user login information has been exposed elsewhere on the web, or if we are compelled to disclose information to law enforcement.

We offer a set of opt-in email subscriptions for things such as newsletters, in-stock notifications for products, and comment reply notifications. You can control your subscriptions (when logged into your account) on the Email Notifications page. All new customers are signed up to our main newsletter by default, and SparkFun may at any time add all new and all existing customers to existing and new newsletters at our discretion.

We may occasionally send you an email that you did not request or trigger with an action of any kind in order to promote a certain aspect of our site, products, or services.

## When you talk to our support teams

If you email us, chat with us, or call us on the telephone for support we can and most of the time will record the interaction. This is done so for training and audit purposes and the private conversations between customers and support staff are never sold to or shared with third parties (except when a third party tool, such as email or our chat service, is used to make the interaction possible).

## Logging and Log Retention

In order to understand traffic to our sites and diagnose technical problems, we log individual web requests. These logs include time of request, individual IP address, referer, and user agent strings. We may retain these logs for up to 60 days, although individually-identifying information will be obscured after one week.

In order to prevent fraud and detect malicious behavior, we log IP addresses for specific actions, such as creating a customer account and placing an order. This information is automatically deleted after no more than 60 days.

Except in the case of malicious traffic, we will not share log data with any third party, unless compelled by legal process to do so.

## Cookies, Tags, Tracking Pixels, and HTTPS

We use cookies, tags, and tracking pixels to know when users are logged in to SparkFun services and to track preferences such as display currencies and the rendering of product menus.

Our analytics software, DoubleClick and CrazyEgg, use tags/tracking pixels to help keep track of how many unique visitors we’re getting, where they come from, and how they navigate our site, unless you’re browsing with Do Not Track enabled. We use this information to inform site improvements.

We do our best to serve all content securely over HTTPS.

## Third Party Services

### Do Not Track

Do Not Track is a standard for telling sites that you don’t want to be tracked. It’s aimed at sites you don’t visit directly, like advertisers and social media platforms.

SparkFun supports the Do Not Track standard. While third party plugins with access to visitor browsing data are limited on sparkfun.com, all are disabled for visitors passing a Do Not Track HTTP header. This includes third party tools for analytics, live chat, and web optimization (described below).

### Email

We use GMail, and mail sent to or from sparkfun.com addresses generally passes through Google’s servers.

Promotional and informative mail sent to mailing lists, such as the newsletter, is sent using HubSpot. Automated mail sent from a triggering event, like a back-in-stock notification, is sent from sparkfun.com directly. All users with accounts can manage all subscriptions via the Email tab in Account Settings. All users can opt out of these lists by clicking Unsubcribe in the emails.

See HubSpot’s privacy policy here.

### Shipping Providers and Export Control

We offer shipping through third parties: FedEx, UPS, and the United States Postal Service (via a service called Endicia). We pass delivery addresses, phone numbers, and invoices to these companies to the extent required for quoting shipping prices and successful delivery of orders.

We comply with United States export regulations and authorities. We use Visual Compliance to automatically screen billing and delivery addresses for potential export control violations. This entails transmission of customer billing and delivery address information to Visual Compliance servers.

### Payment Providers

Credit Card payments are processed through FirstData. All credit card data including the cardholder name, credit card number, expiration date, CVV, and full billing address are sent to FirstData via an API for processing. Details regarding what products a customer is purchasing and other demographic information are not sent to FirstData.

Each transaction is logged by retaining the transaction amount, the cardholder name, the last four digits of the credit card, and the card expiration date. No other credit card data is stored at any point on SparkFun servers. This is in full compliance with the PCI-DSS, which you can read more about in our Compliance Policy.

PayPal is offered as a payment method. When using PayPal on sparkfun.com a user must provide their PayPal email address. The user will then be directed to paypal.com to complete their payment, after which they will be redirected to sparkfun.com to complete the order.

### Analytics

SparkFun uses Google Analytics, HubSpot, DoubleClick, and CrazyEgg to track aggregate behavior of visitors on sparkfun.com.

Google Universal Analytics is a service hosted on Google’s servers, and is our primary analytics tool. It is activated by a JavaScript snippet that loads on every page to send visitor behavioral information to Google. SparkFun uses this information to understand how visitors use our site. Sometimes SparkFun will run A/B tests, where Google Analytics will track cookies set on users to divide them into groups that get slightly different pages to see which perform better. Visitors who have Do Not Track enabled will not have any information sent to Google’s servers for use in analytics.

SparkFun also utilizes Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting. This means we combine personally identifiable information about your SparkFun account, browsing, and shopping habits and merge it with Google’s tracking cookies, all of which goes to Google. This is enabled by default for all visitors to SparkFun.com. You can opt out of this by enabling Do Not Track headers in your browser or installing and enabling the Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-on.

### Content Hosting

We serve image files (like product images) and other resources from Amazon’s CloudFront.

Uses can choose to display a Gravatar associated with the email address on their account. This will expose a hash of the address to the public web and to Gravatar, which may be a privacy concern.

### Chat and Search

We use Olark to offer chat features. Unless a user is browsing with Do Not Track enabled, a small JavaScript fragment is loaded from Olark’s servers on each page. Olark’s Terms of Service

We use Swiftype to provide search results on sparkfun.com for products, blog posts, tutorials, wish lists, and other content. The text of search strings is sent from our servers to Swiftype. We do not send any information about customers to Swiftype.

### Social Media

We maintain accounts on various social media platforms, including Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Pinterest, Flickr, GitHub, YouTube, Ello, and Instagram, and Tumblr. While some of these platforms are themselves invasive of user privacy, we will do our best to apply the principles outlined in the rest of this policy to our use of social media.

We do not make use of third-party social media badges or widgets which function as trackers.

### Ticketing/CRM

We use Desk.com, Salesforce, and HubSpot to manage and prioritize customer contacts, including those by email, phone, chat, and social media.

78,104259,"['privacy shield', 'standard contractual', 'contractual clauses', 'shark hire', 'Google Adwords', 'third parties', 'Data protection', 'data processing', 'data', 'agreement', 'Controller']","This Privacy and Security Policy is provided for the benefit of customers and clients of Spark Hire, Inc. (“Spark Hire”) as well as other consumers and parties who seek information from or about Spark Hire and/or its website(s), particularly www.SparkHire.com (“Website” or “SparkHire.com”).

1\. OPENING STATEMENTS

1.1 Definitions.

Across its various policies, applications (“Apps”), and Website, Spark Hire strives to use the same definitions for particular terms. By doing so, Spark Hire seeks to make its policies and governing documents consistent and user-friendly. For this reason, Spark Hire provides the definitions for these terms in one location and directs you to our Terms of Use for such definitions. 

1.2 Our Commitment to Privacy

At Spark Hire, we respect the privacy and the confidentiality of our customers’ information, particularly our customers’ PII (also commonly referred to as personally identifying information) (“PII”). We are committed to keeping confidential the PII you share with us. This Privacy and Security Policy explains how Spark Hire collects, uses, discloses and protects the information we obtain. 

1.3 Applicability of Privacy and Security Policy

Our Privacy and Security Policy applies to all individuals and entities from whom or for the benefit of whom we receive PII, whether it be collected through our corporate owned websites; Apps; traditional mailing and/or faxing channels; telephone or electronic communications; from some other medium; or from our clients. 

1.4 Website and Apps Not Directed to Minors

The Website is a professional website directed toward individual job seekers, individual consultants, and consultant groups seeking employment as well as employers seeking to hire individual job seekers, individual consultants, or consultant groups or consultant groups for employment. As such, an individual must be aged sixteen (16) or over to create an account through the Website. As such, the Website is not directed toward children or minors. This also applies to all Spark Hire Apps. 

2\. PERSONAL INFORMATION COLLECTED AND HOW IT IS USED

2.1 Personally Identifiable Information or PII is any information that would, by itself, identify you or tend to identify you as a particular individual or entity. This PII may include, but not be limited to, your name, your address, credit card number, bank account information, and/or personal identification number (such as a social security number or driver’s license number). 

2.1.1 PII does not include any public information that is readily attainable through federal, state or local public record distribution channels. 

2.1.2 PII does not include any information that, by itself, could not identify you as a particular individual or entity. 

2.1.3 PII also does not include raw data that becomes aggregated for statistical purposes and cannot, thereafter, be identified with you as a unique individual or entity. 

2.1.4 Spark Hire does consider your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address to be PII and will treat it as such. 

2.2 Information Collected

2.2.1 Spark Hire collects information that is considered PII and other information that, by itself, would not be considered personally identifiable information (“Non- PII”). 

2.2.2 When you create an account and register for services provided through our Website (“Website Services”) and/or our Apps (“App Services”) (collectively, “Spark Hire Services”), we collect information submitted by you including, but not limited to, your username, your full name, company name (if applicable), email address, zip code, and primary industry. We use this information to identify our customers and send notifications related to the use of our Website, Website Services, Apps, App Services, and/or Spark Hire Services. We reserve the right to request additional information from you. 

2.3 Collecting and Using Personally Identifiable Information

2.3.1 Spark Hire will explain how it intends to use PII either before it collects the information (such as in this Privacy and Security Policy) or contemporaneously with the solicitation of such information. Exceptions may exist where the intended use is obvious to a reasonable person. 

2.3.2 Generally, Spark Hire collects personal identifiable information when an individual registers with the Website; uses the Website’s products or services; posts content on the Website; and/or registers through any of our Apps. This information typically includes, at a minimum, a full name, username, company name (if applicable), email address, zip code, primary industry and any additional information provided by the account holder that could identify that account holder. For persons seeking employment, it should be recognized that a collection of information that would otherwise be considered non-PII could transform into PII (eg employment history, employment position at a company). Consequently, an individual account holder must be aware of making public through any of the Spark Hire Services information that could identify them where they seek to keep private their search for employment. The same can be said of consultants and employers in certain circumstances.

2.3.3 We will use the PII collected only for the purposes explained to you. Further, we limit the collection of PII to only that information which is necessary for the purposes explained to you. 

2.3.4 Generally, we use the PII collected and/or received about you in connection with our Apps, Website, Spark Hire Services, and their various features. We also use information collected and/or received about you in connection with other users and advertisers that purchase ads through the Apps or on the Website. For example, we may use the information we receive about you (a) as part of our efforts to keep Spark Hire safe and secure; (b) to provide you with location features and services, like telling you how far a job opening is from you or notifying you of jobs that pertain to your qualifications or keywords in your profile or if a job fair is nearby; (c) to measure or understand the effectiveness of ads you and others see; (d) to provide Spark Hire Services; (e) to make suggestions to you and other users on Spark Hire; and (e) provide support.

","Since its inception, Spark Hire has valued the trust its customers place in it to professionally and securely provide services and store data related to their employment and recruiting. With this trust in mind, Spark Hire invested time and resources to become compliant with the Safe Harbor program that bridged the gap between United States and European Union privacy laws. Spark Hire also examines the developing law in jurisdictions outside the U.S. and EU. In this context, Spark Hire has decided to become compliant with the General Data Protection Regulation that became effective in the EU in May 2018. Spark Hire adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles.

In our efforts to heighten the protections we provide our customers around the world, we have implemented new changes to our policies and practices. Our efforts on behalf of our customers will continue. We will keep you informed as we do so.

### 1.2 Our Commitment to Privacy

At Spark Hire, we respect the privacy and the confidentiality of our customers’ information, particularly our customers’ PII (also commonly referred to as personally identifiable information) (“PII”).

### 1.3 Applicability of Privacy and Security Policy 

Our Privacy and Security Policy applies to all individuals and entities from whom or for the benefit of whom we receive PII, whether it be collected through our corporate owned websites; Apps; traditional mailing and/or faxing channels; telephone or electronic communications; from some other medium; and/or from our clients.

In this context, the website also accepts individuals as customers who respond to certain invitations to use Spark Hire Services. As such, an individual must be aged sixteen (16) or over to create an account through the Website. As such, the Website is not directed toward children or minors. This also applies to all Spark Hire Apps.

### 1.6 Onward Transfer Liability

## 2\. PERSONAL INFORMATION COLLECTED AND HOW IT IS USED

### 2.1 Personally Identifiable Information or PII

is any information that would, by itself, identify you or tend to identify you as a particular individual or entity. This PII may include, but not be limited to, your name, your address, credit card number, bank account information, and/or personal identification number (such as a social security number or driver’s license number).

2.1.1 PII does not include any public information that is readily attainable through federal, state or local public record distribution channels.

2.1.2 PII does not include any information that, by itself, could not identify you as a particular individual or entity.

2.1.3 PII also does not include raw data that becomes aggregated for statistical purposes and cannot, thereafter, be identified with you as a unique individual or entity.

2.1.4 Spark Hire does consider your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address to be PII and will treat it as such.

### 2.2 Information Collected

2.2.1 Spark Hire collects information that is considered PII and other information that, by itself, would not be considered personally identifiable information (“Non-PII”).

2.2.2 When you create an account and register for any of our Spark Hire Services (whether through a Website, App, or other portal), we collect information submitted by you including, but not limited to, your full name, company name (if applicable), email address, phone number, and IP address. We use this information to identify our customers and send notifications related to the use of our Spark Hire Services. We reserve the right to request additional information from you.

2.2.3 For our business customers, Spark Hire shall also collect information relating to one or more of your financial accounts for purposes of processing payments to provide you with Spark Hire Services.  This information may likely contain both PII and Non-PII depending on the nature of the account holder information.

2.2.4 Spark Hire provides its services for free to individuals invited to use Spark Hire by one of its business customers. As this constitutes the only basis for which individuals can use Spark Hire Services at this time, there exists no reason for an individual customer to provide financial information to Spark Hire or any of its business customers inviting such individuals to use Spark Hire Services. Based on the foregoing, business customers of Spark Hire are expressly prohibited from requesting and/or collecting consumer financial information through any Spark Hire Services. Should any consumer be requested to provide such information, please report it immediately to Spark Hire at privacy@sparkhire.com.

### 2.3 Collecting and Using Personally Identifiable Information

2.3.1 Spark Hire will explain how it intends to use PII either before it collects the information (such as in this Privacy and Security Policy) or contemporaneously with the solicitation of such information. Exceptions may exist where the intended use is obvious to a reasonable person.

2.3.2 Generally, Spark Hire collects personal identifiable information when an individual registers with or uses any of the Spark Hire Services. This information typically includes, at a minimum, a full name, company name (if applicable), email address, phone number, mobile phone number, and any additional information provided by the account holder that could identify that account holder. For persons seeking employment, it should be recognized that a collection of information that would otherwise be considered non-PII could transform into PII (eg employment history, employment position at a company). Consequently, an individual account holder must be cautious in making public through any of the Spark Hire Services information that could identify them where they seek to keep private their search for employment. The same can be said of consultants and employers in certain circumstances.

2.3.3 We will use the PII collected only for the purposes explained to you. Further, we limit the collection of PII to only that information which is necessary for the purposes explained to you.

2.3.4 Generally, we use the PII collected and/or received about you in connection with our Apps, Website, Spark Hire Services, and their various features. We also use information collected and/or received about you in connection with other users and advertisers that purchase ads through the Apps or on the Website.

For example, we may use the information we receive about you (a) as part of our efforts to keep Spark Hire safe and secure; (b) to provide Spark Hire Services; (c) to make suggestions to you and other users on Spark Hire; and (d) provide support.

Granting us this permission not only allows us to provide Spark Hire as it exists today, but it also allows us to provide you with innovative features and services we develop in the future that use the PII we receive about you in new ways.

We may use your PII to communicate with you for the foregoing and other reasons by email, text message, phone call, or other electronic, written or oral communication method, unless you expressly indicate to Spark Hire not to use a particular method of communication.

While you are allowing us to use the PII we receive about you, you always own all of your information. Your trust is important to us, which is why we don't share PII we receive about you with others unless we have received your express permission for the information to be used for such purpose.

Additionally, we may use aggregated information derived from PII to improve the Spark Hire Services and any related matters thereto.

2.3.5 Unless we are required to do so by law, we shall not obtain your consent before collecting PII about you from parties other than Spark Hire. Rather, Spark Hire shall presume that you have previously provided such consent to any such third party from whom Spark Hire obtains such information. This only applies to information provided by third parties to Spark Hire. Spark Hire does not provide third parties with access to your account information and only shares your information with third parties where we have your consent to do so.

2.3.6 In the normal course of its business operations, Spark Hire restricts the use of your PII to Spark Hire’s personnel and its Strategic Partners.  However, by using Spark Hire Services, you may necessarily disclose PII to potential employers and Staffing Customers when they access your information, profiles, interviews, and other Content. Indeed, as individuals will only be using Spark Hire Services at the invitation of an employer or staffing company, you necessarily will be providing such entity with information when you respond to the invitation.

2.3.7 We shall not sell your PII in the normal course of business operations. Should all or any part of Spark Hire’s business operations be sold, this paragraph shall not by itself restrict the transfer of your PII as part of the Website sold to a third party. However, the ability to transfer such information may be governed by law in your applicable jurisdiction. In such cases, Spark Hire shall comply with applicable law, provide notice, and seek consent prior to any such transfer.

2.3.8 We may also use the PII you provide in registering with and using Spark Hire to inform you by electronic mail, phone, text or other communication method of additional products and services about which you might be interested, which may include our periodic e-newsletters and other promotional communications from Spark Hire.

### 2.4 Disclosing Personal Information

2.4.2.1 Spark Hire may use PII in the normal course of providing the Spark Hire Services; to operate or improve the Apps, Website and/or Spark Hire Services; to outsource certain services to Strategic Partners; to complete a transaction that has been requested; to develop aggregate information; and/or as otherwise disclosed to you.

Upon notice of unauthorized processing by Third-Party Customers or Spark Hire Customers, Spark Hire will take reasonable and appropriate steps to stop and remediate unauthorized processing.

2.4.2.5 In some cases, Spark Hire Customers may be able to download your videos and other public information, and store them on, their computers and servers.  Other Spark Hire Customers may also be able to use shared links by which they provide related parties who might not also be Spark Hire Customers access to your content.

2.4.3 Strategic Partners. Spark Hire may employ, engage or retain certain trusted third parties (“Strategic Partners”) to perform functions and/or provide services on its behalf, such as web hosting, integrated services, or advertising. Spark Hire will share PII with these Strategic Partners only to the extent necessary to perform the functions and/or provide the services for which they have been employed, engaged or retained. Spark Hire shall also secure contractual obligations from our Strategic Partners to maintain the privacy and security of the PII shared with them at the same level of privacy protection as outlined in the Privacy Shield Principles. Upon notice of unauthorized processing by a Strategic Partner, Spark Hire will take reasonable and appropriate steps to stop and remediate unauthorized processing. Some of the Strategic Partners that may receive access to your PII to provide the Spark Hire Services have been listed below.

2.4.4 Business Transfers. Spark Hire reserves the right to sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets, including PII, in connection with a sale of assets; a merger, acquisition, or reorganization; or, filing for bankruptcy. You will have the opportunity to opt out of any such transfer if the planned processing of your information by the purchaser differs materially from that set forth in this Privacy and Security Policy.

2.4.5 Legal Compliance. Spark Hire may be required to disclose any information about you and/or Content created by you in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. We may also disclose any information about you and/or Content created by you as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to: (1) comply with an order from a court of competent jurisdiction, regulatory agency, and/or other governmental authority; (2) respond to claims, court orders, or other legal process (including subpoenas); (3) to enforce the terms of this and other Spark Hire agreements as well as to protect the property and rights of Spark Hire, its Strategic Partners or other third parties; (4) to protect, in Spark Hire’s sole discretion, the public or any person from harm; (5) to investigate, prevent, stop, or take other action regarding any action perceived to be fraudulent, illegal, unethical, or legally actionable in Spark Hire’s sole discretion; and/or, generally, (6) to comply with the law.

2.4.6 Notice. Unless restricted from doing so, Spark Hire will attempt to notify you before it releases any of your PII or Content pursuant to (1) and (2) in paragraph 2.4.5 only. In such cases, Spark Hire will also provide you with general information on how you may seek to block such a release of information and/or direct you to resources that can provide such general information. The provision of such general information to you is not and should not be construed as providing you with legal advice. Additionally, Spark Hire is under no other obligation to assist you in challenging or opposing a release of your information

2.4.7 Onward Transfer Liability. Spark Hire may be liable for onward transfers of personal data to third parties in violation of this policy and the Privacy Shield.

### SCHEDULE 1

### DATA PROCESSING AGREEMENT

For those Spark Hire customers using PII from EU residents, we include here as part of our Privacy and Security Policy our Data Processing Agreement.

### INTRODUCTION

This Spark Hire Data Processing Agreement (“DPA”) reflects the parties’ agreement with respect to the terms governing the processing of personal data and is included as a subsection of the Spark Hire Privacy and Security Policy (“Privacy Policy”). As such, the terms of the Privacy and Security Policy and Spark Hire Terms of Use (“Terms of Use”) apply to this DPA.

In all cases, Spark Hire (“Processor”), or a third party acting on behalf of the Processor, acts as the processor of personal data and the employer or staffing company for whom Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”) is obtained from Individuals shall be the Controller. The terms of this DPA shall follow the terms of the Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use and any terms not otherwise defined in the DPA shall follow the definitions used in the Terms of Use.

### THIS DPA INCLUDES:

(i) Standard Contractual Clauses, attached hereto as SCHEDULE 1.

  * (a) APPENDIX 1 to the Standard Contractual Clauses, specifying the types of personal data processed by Spark Hire.
  * (b) APPENDIX 2 to the Standard Contractual Clauses, which includes a description of the technical and organizational security measures implemented by Spark Hire.



(ii) List of Subcontractors, attached hereto as SCHEDULE 2.

### 1\. Scope and Responsibility

The Processor will process personal data on behalf of Controller, as necessary to perform the services pursuant to the Privacy Policy, the DPA, and the Terms of Use (“Policies”). Processing shall include such actions as may be specified in the Policies.

The Processor will process personal data for the duration of the Policies and other relevant contracts unless otherwise agreed upon in writing.

The Controller shall be entitled to demand the modification, deletion, blocking and making available of personal data during and after the applicable term in accordance with the further specifications of such agreement on return and deletion of personal data.

The terms of this DPA shall equally apply if testing or maintenance of automatic processes or of processing equipment is performed on behalf of Controller, and access to personal data in such context cannot be excluded.

### 2\. Obligations of Processor

The Processor shall collect, process and use personal data only within the scope of Controller’s instructions. If the Processor thinks that an instruction of the Controller infringes the E.U. General Data Protection Regulation or the U.S.-E.U. Privacy Shield protections, it shall point this out to the Controller without delay.

The Processor shall structure the Processor’s internal corporate organization to ensure compliance with the E.U. General Data Protection Regulation or the U.S.-E.U. Privacy Shield protections. Such measures hereunder shall include, but not be limited to,

a) preventing unauthorized access to personal data processing systems (physical access control);

b) preventing unauthorized processing or use of personal data (logical access control);

c) ensuring that persons entitled to use a personal data processing system gain access only to such personal data as they are entitled to access, and that, in the course of processing or use and after storage, personal data cannot be read, copied, modified or deleted without authorization (data access control);

d) ensuring that personal data cannot be read, copied, modified or deleted without authorization during electronic transmission, transport or storage on storage media, and that the target entities for any transfer of personal data by means of data transmission facilities can be established and verified (data transfer control);

e) ensuring proper records are maintained to document whether and by whom personal data has been entered into, modified in, or removed from personal data processing systems (entry control);

f) ensuring that personal data is processed solely in accordance with the instructions of the Controller (control of instructions);

g) ensuring that personal data is protected against accidental destruction or loss (availability control);

h) ensuring that personal data collected for different purposes can be processed separately (separation control);

An overview of the above listed technical and organizational measures shall be attached to this DPA as APPENDIX 2.

The Processor shall ensure that any personnel entrusted with processing Controller’s personal data have undertaken to comply with the principle of data secrecy in accordance with the E.U. General Data Protection Regulation and the U.S.-E.U. Privacy Shield protections and have been duly instructed on them.

Spark Hire has identified a Data Protection Officer in its Privacy and Security Policy.

Processor shall, without undue delay, inform the Controller in case of a serious interruption of operations or violations by the Processor or persons employed by it of provisions to protect personal data or of terms specified in this DPA. In such an event, the Processor shall implement the measures necessary to secure the Personal Data and to mitigate potential adverse effects on the data subjects without undue delay.

The Controller shall retain title as to any carrier media provided to Processor as well as any copies or reproductions thereof. The Processor shall store such media safely and protect them against unauthorized access by third parties. The Processor shall, upon Controller’s request, provide to Controller all information on Controller’s personal data and personal information. Processor shall be obliged to securely delete any test and scrap material based on an instruction issued by the Controller on a case-by-case basis. Where the Controller so decides, the Processor shall hand over such material to the Controller or store it on the Controller’s behalf.

The Processor shall be obliged to audit and verify the fulfillment of the above-entitled obligations and shall maintain an adequate documentation of such verification.

### 3\. Obligations of Controller

The Controller and the Processor shall be separately responsible for conforming with such statutory data protection regulations as are applicable to them in accordance with the E.U. General Data Protection Regulation and the U.S.-E.U. Privacy Shield protections.

The Controller shall inform the Processor without undue delay and comprehensively about any errors or irregularities related to statutory provisions on the processing of personal data detected during a verification of the results of such processing.

The Controller shall, upon instruction or termination or expiration of the Terms, stipulate, within a period of time set by the Processor, the reasonable measures to return data carrier media or to delete stored data.

### 4\. Enquiries by Data Subjects to Controller

Where the Controller, based upon applicable data protection law, is obliged to provide information to an individual about the collection, processing or use or its personal data, the Processor shall assist the Controller in making this information available, provided that: (i) the Controller has instructed the Processor in writing to do so, and (ii) the Controller reimburses the Processor for the costs arising from this assistance.

Where a data subject requests the Processor to correct, delete or block personal data, the Processor shall refer such data subject to the Controller.

### 5\. Subcontractors

The Processor shall be entitled to subcontract the Processor’s obligations defined in the Policies to third parties only with the Controller’s written consent (which shall be affirmed by a Controller’s agreement to the policies).

Controller consents to Processor’s subcontracting to Processor’s affiliated companies and third parties, as listed in SCHEDULE 2, of Processor’s contractual obligations hereunder.

If the Processor intends to instruct subcontractors other than the companies listed in SCHEDULE 2, the Processor must notify the Controller thereof in writing (email to the email address(es) on record in Processor’s account information for Controller is sufficient) and must give the Controller the possibility to object against the instruction of the subcontractor within 30 days after being notified. The objection must be based on reasonable grounds (e.g. if the Controller proves that significant risks for the protection of its Personal Data exist at the subcontractor). If the Processor and the Controller are unable to resolve such objection, either party may terminate the Terms of Use by providing written notice to the other party.

The provisions of this section also apply if the Processor uses a subcontractor in a third country. The Controller hereby authorizes the Processor, to agree in the name and on behalf of the Controller with a subcontractor which processes or uses the personal data of the Controller outside of the EEA, to enter into EU Standard Contractual Clauses for the Transfer of Personal Data to Processors Established in Third Countries dated 5 February 2010. This applies accordingly from the date of this authorization with respect to EU Standard Contractual Clauses (Processors) already concluded by the Processor with such subcontractors.

### 6\. Duties to Inform

Where the Processor’s personal data becomes subject to search and seizure, an attachment order, confiscation during bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings, or similar events or measures by third parties while being processed, the Processor shall inform the Controller without undue delay. Processor shall, without undue delay, notify to all pertinent parties in such action, that any personal data affected is the Controller’s sole property and area of responsibility.

In case of any conflict, the regulations of this DPA shall take precedence over the regulations of the Policies. Where individual regulations of this DPA are invalid or unenforceable, the validity and enforceability of the other regulations of this DPA shall not be affected.

The Standard Contractual Clauses in SCHEDULE 1 will apply to the processing of Personal Data by Processor under the Policies. Upon the incorporation of this DPA into the Terms of Use, the parties are agreeing to the Standard Contractual Clauses in SCHEDULE 1 and all appendixes attached. In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between this DPA and the Standard Contractual Clauses, the Standard Contractual Clauses shall prevail.

The Standard Contractual Clauses apply only to personal data that is transferred from the European Economic Area (EEA) to outside the EEA, either directly or via onward transfer, to any country or recipient: (i) not recognized by the European Commission as providing an adequate level of protection for personal data (as described in the EU Data Protection Directive), and (ii) not covered by a suitable framework recognized by the relevant authorities or courts as providing an adequate level of protection for personal data, including but not limited to binding corporate rules for processors.

### 7\. Parties to this DPA

This DPA is an amendment to and forms part of the Privacy and Security Policy.

The legal entity agreeing to this DPA as Controller represents that it is authorized to agree to and enter into this DPA for, and is agreeing to this DPA solely on behalf of, the Controller.

Privacy Policy

Thank you for visiting a website of Christianity Today International (CTI). Protecting your privacy is very important to us. To assure you of your privacy, we provide this notice to help you understand our commitment to security, what kinds of information we may gather about you when you visit the site, how we may use that information, and how you can correct the information.

Our Commitment to Security

Safeguards  
We have appropriate physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards in place in our physical facilities to help protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of any information you may have provided at our site. We always use industry-standard encryption technologies when transferring and receiving consumer data exchanged with our site. When we transfer and receive certain types of sensitive information such as financial information, we redirect visitors to a secure server and will notify visitors through a pop-up screen on our site.

Credit Card Safety  
Ordering online with us is a secure transaction. All online transactions in CTI's online stores are handled with industry-standard SSL encryption. This means that when you enter your credit card number into the order form, it is transmitted across the Internet in an encrypted (scrambled) form, and then decoded when it gets to us.

E-mail Addresses  
When you provide CTI with your e-mail address, we will use it only for the purpose for which it was provided. We do not rent, sell, or exchange your e-mail address with any third party except to provide the services you request or as required by law (see ""Other Entities"" section below).

Information We Collect

Automatically Collected Anonymous Information  
When you visit a CTI website, certain anonymous information about your visit is automatically logged as it is at most websites, which may include information about your IP address, domain name, browser type, access time, and referring website address. This information is not personally identifiable and is only used in aggregate (not in any way that personally identifies you).

Personally Identifiable Information  
Personally Identifiable Information is any information about you as an individual that would enable someone to contact you; for example, your name, address, telephone number, or e-mail address.

CTI will not collect any personally identifiable information about you unless you provide it. Providing any personally identifiable information to CTI is voluntary. If you do not want CTI to obtain any personally identifiable information about you, do not submit it.

How We Use This Information

We will use your information only as permitted by law. Aggregated information may be used in many ways. For example, we may combine information about your usage patterns with similar information obtained from other users to learn which pages are visited most or what features are most attractive. Aggregated information may occasionally be shared with our advertisers and business partners, but cannot be used to contact you individually.

Personally identifiable information will be used for the purposes for which it was given. We also may use it to notify you about updates to our website and to contact you for marketing purposes.

You can visit and browse CTI's websites without revealing personally identifiable information about yourself. You may also choose to disclose personally identifiable information about yourself for the purposes described below.

E-mail Newsletters  
When you request a free e-mail newsletter from us, we will collect and store your e-mail address to provide you with the requested newsletter. We may also send you occasional special offers and information from CTI and other select sources we think would be of interest to you. You may change your subscribed e-mail address, opt-out of receiving special e-mailed offers, or remove yourself from any mailing list by following the instructions contained in every newsletter. We do not rent, sell, or exchange your e-mail address with any third party except to provide the services you request or as required by law (see ""Other Entities"" section below).

Requests for Magazines, Products or Services  
When you request a magazine, product, or service from us, we will collect and store your name, address, credit card number, and other basic personally identifiable information to provide you with the requested product or service and for billing purposes. We may also offer you, by direct mail, products from CTI and other select sources we think would be of interest to you.

Your e-mail address will also be obtained during the online ordering process for the purpose of corresponding with you about your purchase and to occasionally notify you of additional online shopping opportunities. You may opt-out of receiving any subsequent shopping opportunities by following the unsubscribe information found in each e-mail announcement. Again, we will not rent, sell, or exchange your e-mail address with a third party for any purpose except to provide the services you request or as required by law.

Third Party Direct Marketing  
We occasionally rent our customer list (not including e-mail addresses) to other organizations to offer you products that may be of interest to you by direct mail.

Opting Out of Third Party Direct Marketing: After receiving the product or service requested, you may ""opt-out"" of receiving Third Party Direct Marketing offers by sending an e-mail stating your request to opt-out along with your complete name, mailing address, and the name of the CTI magazine, product, or service you have received. This information is necessary so we can accurately process your request.

Surveys  
CTI occasionally conducts reader surveys to better target content to our audience. We sometimes share the aggregated demographic information in these surveys with our advertisers and partners. We never share with any third party information collected via surveys about specific individuals.

Contests and Sweepstakes  
CTI occasionally offers contests and sweepstakes. These contests and sweepstakes are conducted in full accordance with federal and state laws. The full rules for our contests are clearly posted during each event. Information gathered is used by CTI only to verify user identity and to contact winners and/or prize recipients.

CTI occasionally may offer contests or sweepstakes that are sponsored by or co-sponsored with third parties as identified in the contest or sweepstakes' Official Rules. By virtue of their sponsorship, these third parties may obtain personally identifiable information that visitors voluntarily submit to participate in the contest or sweepstakes. CTI has no control over the third-party sponsors' use of this information.

Other Services  
CTI offers free services such as ""e-mail this page"" and e-cards. We collect the domain name, e-mail address, and name of visitors who choose to use these services in order to fulfill their requests. We also collect the e-mail addresses and names of the people to whom our visitors choose to send pages or e-cards in order to enable our visitors to send the pages and e-cards they have chosen and for no other purpose.

Other Entities  
Companies that are independent from CTI operate many of the online areas that you may visit via links from ChristianityToday.com. Although CTI will seek to require that these independent companies (e.g., information and paid subscription service providers, advertisers, merchants, and contest or sweepstakes sponsors) adhere to our strong privacy principles, CTI does not bear responsibility for their policies or actions. Please read their unique site privacy policies.

Certain CTI Internet services and websites are co-branded (such as ChurchSiteCreator.com and Faith in the Workplace) and offered in conjunction with another company. If you register to use such services or subscribe to their e-mail newsletter, both CTI and the other company may receive the information you provide.

Many CTI online stores are hosted by Yahoo! Store. Yahoo! hosts the store pages, ordering system, and order data. Yahoo! automatically collects order information but may only use this information in the aggregate. If you access one of these stores through Yahoo! Shopping, Yahoo! also automatically collects information about your shopping experience. Please see the Yahoo! Privacy Policy for more information about how Yahoo! uses this information.

CTI reserves the right to cooperate with law enforcement officials in the investigation of alleged unlawful activities of our customers related to electronic communication transmitted on our site. CTI will have no legal liability for such disclosures.

Cookies  
Cookies are a technology that helps us serve you better. Our cookies collect no personally identifiable information. We use cookies to help us know when and how many people visit our site; to store your personal preferences for paid online subscription services you may subscribe to, in order to provide you with the best experience possible; to ensure that visitors are not repeatedly sent the same pop-up ads; and to record session information, such as items that consumers add to their shopping cart.

Information for Children and Parents

Kids and Teens  
Be sure to ask your parents for permission before sending us any information about yourself. If you are under 18, you must have your parents' or guardian's permission to order any products or services from us. If you are under the age of 13, do not use our chat and message boards. If you are between the ages of 13 and 18, you may use our Teen message boards, but never post your full name, address, phone number, or school name on any message board or in any chat room.

Parents  
CTI's Internet sites are general audience sites, and CTI does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. Any information collected online by CTI from children under 18 is used only for the purpose of delivering the requested product or service. Please instruct your children to ask you for permission before providing any information about themselves to CTI, and visit the Federal Trade Commission website for more information about safe Web surfing.

Your California Privacy Rights  
Beginning on January 1, 2005, California Civil Code Section 1798.83 requires CTI (1) to enable its customers who are California residents to request certain information regarding its disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes or (2) to offer the opportunity for customers to opt out of having their personal information disclosed to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes. We have always offered the second option, as described above in the ""Third Party Direct Marketing"" section. If you prefer not to receive such direct marketing offers, please feel free to make your request known as explained above.

Updates to Privacy Policy  
From time to time, we may update this privacy notice. Please check this page periodically for changes. We will notify you about any changes in the way we treat personally identifiable information by placing a notice on our site.

The Privacy Policy posted on this site was updated on or about February 22, 2007.

CTI welcomes your comments regarding this Privacy Policy. If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to contact us.

  

","Thank you for visiting a website of Christianity Today (CT). Protecting your privacy is very important to us. To assure you of your privacy, we provide this notice to help you understand our commitment to security, what kinds of information we may gather about you when you visit our websites, how we may use that information, and how you can correct the information.

#### Information We Collect

Automatically Collected Anonymous Information  
When you visit a CT website, certain anonymous information about your visit is automatically logged as it is at most websites, which may include information about your IP address, domain name, browser type, mobile device type, access time, and referring website address. This information is not personally identifiable and is only used in aggregate (not in any way that personally identifies you).

Personally Identifiable Information  
Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is any information about you as an individual that would enable someone to contact you; for example, your name, address, telephone number, or email address. We may ask for such information when you subscribe to an email newsletter, order a magazine or website subscription or other product or service, participate in an online survey, post a comment, enter a contest or sweepstakes, or use a service or tool such as emailing a page.

We will not collect any PII about you unless you provide it. Providing any PII to us is voluntary. If you do not want us to obtain any personally identifiable information about you, do not submit it.

At some CT websites, you may submit information about other people. For example, you might submit a recipient's name and address to send a gift. We will use this information only to fulfill your request and for no other purpose.

You can visit and browse our websites without revealing any PII, but you may not be able to access certain content, features or services if you choose not to disclose PII.

#### How We Use This Information

Aggregated information may be used in many ways. For example, we may combine information about the usage patterns of our visitors to learn which pages are visited most or what features are most attractive. Aggregated information may occasionally be shared with our advertisers and business partners, but it cannot be used to contact you individually.

PII you provide voluntarily may be used to improve the content of our websites, to fulfill your requests for our products and services, to correspond with you about your purchases or notify you if you win a contest prize, to notify you of updates to our website, shared with agents or contractors who assist in providing support for our internal operations, transferred to a successor entity in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, sale of assets or other corporate change respecting our websites,  used by us to contact you for our or other reputable organizations' marketing purposes, and shared with third-parties for marketing purposes. (Email marketing promotions are sent via our own system rather than sharing email addresses with third parties.)

CT may use PII to provide Internet security and to meet legal requirements. As a result, CT reserves the right to cooperate with law enforcement officials in the investigation of alleged unlawful activities committed on or through our websites. CT may disclose PII in the course of officially authorized law enforcement investigations or as required to comply with a current judicial proceeding, court order, warrant, subpoena or other legal process served on CT. Further, in the event of a suspected attempt to deliberately circumvent our websites' security with the intent to gain unauthorized access or to do physical damage, CT may share PII about a suspected intruder with law enforcement officials. CT shall have no legal liability for such disclosures. Notwithstanding any of the above, CT reserves the right to challenge the validity of any subpoena, court order, warrant or other legal process, in its sole discretion.

If you choose to post comments to a blog or article, any information you submit may become public. It may become accessible through search engines or, if you sign in using credentials from a third-party social networking service, it may become accessible to users on that service. Unless otherwise noted, we do not limit the distribution of information that you share using these features. CT is not responsible for any personal information you choose to make public via these forums, and you agree that such sharing will be deemed to have been permitted by you, not CT. If you prefer not to have your information published, do not submit it.

If you choose to submit content for publication (e.g., a letter to the editor), we may publish any information you have provided to us. If you prefer not to have your PII published, do not include it in your submission.

If you wish to opt out of the use of your PII for marketing purposes, please let us know via the following links:

> Print or Site Subscribers, Online Store Customers and Other Information Sources: Contact Customer Care.

#### Cookies & Web Beacons

Cookies are a technology that helps us serve you better. Our cookies collect no personally identifiable information. We use cookies to help us know when and how many people visit our websites; to store your personal preferences for paid online subscription services you may subscribe to, in order to provide you with the best experience possible; and to record session information, such as items that you add to your shopping cart.

Our third party service providers and advertisers may also use cookies to manage and measure the performance of advertisements displayed on or delivered by or through our websites and to provide more relevant advertising. See ""Collection of Information by Third-Parties, Ad Servers, and Sponsors"" below for more information.

CT, our third party service providers or advertisers may use web beacons (clear .gifs) or similar technologies, which are small pieces of code placed on a web page or in an email newsletter, to monitor the behavior and collect data about the visitors viewing the web page or email newsletter. For example, web beacons may be used to count the users who visit a web page, open an email newsletter or deliver a cookie to the browser of a visitor viewing a web page.

You have the choice to set your browser to accept all cookies, notify you when a cookie is set, delete cookies periodically, or reject all cookies. Generally, deleting or rejecting cookies also disables web beacons. Please be aware that rejecting all cookies may prevent you from enjoying the full features offered through CT's and other websites. Check the ""Help"" section of your browser for more information.

#### Collection of Information by Third Parties, Sponsors and Ad Servers

Advertisers and websites that have links on our websites may collect information directly from you if you click an advertisement or link to visit another website. This Privacy Policy applies only to information you provide to us and not to any information you may provide to a third party. Please consult the privacy policy of any other website you visit to know what information they may collect and how they may use it.

CT sometimes partners with third parties that operate websites and services you can use. For example:

> A website may be cobranded. When you provide personal information via a cobranded website, you may have the option of providing it to either or both parties.

> An online store may be hosted by Yahoo! Store. Yahoo! hosts the store pages, ordering system, and order data. Yahoo! automatically collects order information but may only use this information in the aggregate, according to the Privacy Policy posted on Yahoo! Stores. You may read an example here. 

> A contest or sweepstakes may be sponsored by or co-sponsored with third parties as identified in the contest or sweepstakes' Official Rules. By virtue of these relationships, the third parties may obtain PII that visitors voluntarily submit to participate in the website activity. We have no control over these third parties' use of this information. Consult the Official Rules to determine whether these third parties will obtain such information.

> CT provides readers the convenience of signing onto our websites using third-party social login credentials for accounts such as Facebook, Twitter, Linked-In or Google. This allows you to link your existing social profile to your CT account. Once connected, you will be able to post content directly on our websites or share content to social networks from our websites. Our websites may also access certain information from your third-party social profile such as your name, profile picture, gender, and email address.

#### Ad Choices

Some of the advertisements you see on CT websites are delivered by third parties who may also collect information through cookies and web beacons about your online activities on CT websites or across the Internet, in an effort to understand your interests and deliver advertisements that are relevant to you. Often our ads are based on the content of pages you are viewing, but third parties may also provide ads tailored to your interests.

Third parties that may collect information on our websites in order to serve advertising tailored to your interest may include but is not limited to Atlas, DoubleClick, EyeWonder, MediaMind, and Pointroll. Find more information about their privacy policies and whether they offer a way to choose not to have your information used for advertising purposes by clicking on the hyperlinked company names. If these companies are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI), you may also find opt-out information at the NAI consumer opt out page. You may also learn more about the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) and how to make choices about interest-based ads from participating third parties by visiting the DAA consumer opt out page.

#### Use by Minors

CT's websites are general audience websites, and we do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. Any information collected online by CT from children under 18 is used only for the purpose of delivering the requested product or service. Please instruct your children to ask you for permission before providing any information about themselves to CT, and visit the Federal Trade Commission website for more information about safe online surfing.

#### Your California Privacy Rights

Beginning on January 1, 2005, California Civil Code Section 1798.83 requires CT (1) to enable its customers who are California residents to request certain information regarding its disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes or (2) to offer the opportunity for customers to opt out of having their personal information disclosed to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes. We have always offered the second option, as described above in the ""How We Use This Information"" section. If you prefer not to receive such direct marketing offers, please feel free to make your request known as explained above.

By using this website and submitting any personal information, visitors from outside of the USA acknowledge that this website is subject to USA law, consent to the transfer of personal data to the USA, and waive any claims that may arise under their own national laws. If you do not want your personal information transferred to the USA, do not provide it on this website.

#### Our Commitment to Security

CT has appropriate physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards in place at its physical location to help protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of any information you may provide via our websites, including address information and credit card numbers. We use industry-standard encryption technologies when transferring and receiving consumer data exchanged with our websites. When we transfer and receive certain types of sensitive information such as financial information, we redirect visitors to a secure server and notify visitors through a pop-up screen on our website.

Your Privacy
At Sony we believe our online visitors have a right to know our practices regarding the
information we may collect when you visit our Web sites and what type of information is
collected. The guidelines contained herein apply only to your visit to the Web sites
operated by or for Sony Electronics Inc. and the entities it controls (collectively, “SEL”).
These sites include, but are not limited to, those that contain “sel.sony.com” and those
that contain “sonystyle.com” in their URLs. Sites which are linked to/from these sites
(including sites of other Sony affiliated companies (e.g., Sony Music Entertainment,
Sony Pictures Entertainment, Sony Computer Entertainment America) and via banner
ads) may have different policies; therefore, please review the privacy policy notices on
those sites for details.
While SEL does not generally require that you provide us with personally identifiable
information in order to visit and use the SEL sites, please note that in order to participate
in some activities, it will be necessary for you to provide this information. If you choose
not to provide it for those activities, you may not be able to participate in them.
[Notice to California Residents – Your California Privacy Rights: If you are a
California resident, you have the right to receive: a) information identifying any
third party company(ies) to whom Sony Electronics Inc. may have disclosed,
within the past year, personal information pertaining to you and your family for
that company’s direct marketing purposes; and b) a description of the categories
of personal information disclosed. To obtain such information, please email your
request to Privacy@am.sony.com.]
Collection of Information:
For each visitor to an SEL Web site, SEL’s Web server automatically recognizes,
collects and/or stores information such as the visitor’s IP address/Domain name
combination and any referring sites. SEL may use several technologies to accomplish
this. Examples of such technologies are cookies and Web beacons.
When you visit SEL’s Web sites or advertisements appearing thereon, or use one or
more of the SEL Web site services, we may use an industry-wide technology called
""cookies"" which stores certain information on your computer and which will allow us to


customize your experience to better match your interests and preferences or to simply
facilitate your signing in to use the services. Most browsers will allow you to erase
cookies from your computer hard drive, block acceptance of cookies, or receive a
warning before a cookie is stored. However, if you block or erase cookies, we may not
be able to restore any preferences or customization settings you previously specified
and our ability to personalize your online experience would be limited. Please refer to
your browser instructions or “help” screen to learn more about these functions. SEL
may also itself use, or engage third parties to use, Web beacons for researching certain
usage and activities on our Web site. The information collected by SEL or requested
from third parties through these Web beacons is in an aggregate, non-individually
identifiable form and is used to find out more about users including demographic
information and usage patterns for more accurate reporting and to improve the
effectiveness of our marketing.
SEL may ask you to provide “personal information”, meaning individually identifiable
information such as your email address, name, mailing address, telephone number,
social security number, credit card number, or persistent identifier (such as a customer
number held in a cookie) which is associated with individually identifiable information, to
enable you to participate in contests, chat rooms, on bulletin boards, to fill out a
registration, or to order products and services using these sites. SEL may combine the
information you provide on our Web sites with information we may collect offline from
you or from third parties so that we can more effectively tailor our site, services and
offerings to you.
SEL will not share the personal information you provide on the SEL Web sites
with any other parties, except (a) to other affiliated Sony companies (i.e., (i) Sony
Corporation, (ii) any company of which more than 50% of its outstanding shares are
owned by Sony Corporation, directly or indirectly, and (iii) any company with the name
“SONY” as a part of its trade name) who may want to contact you about products,
services or other offerings that may be of interest to you (SEL and such affiliates being
collectively referred to as “Sony”), (b) with your consent (see paragraph below), (c) as
may be required by law or court order, (d) to persons or companies with whom SEL
engages to carry out or provide support for the operations of the site or our business, or
(e) to appropriate third parties, including law enforcement or other government agencies,
in connection with a criminal investigation, fraud prevention, or other legal action or if
SEL reasonably believes it is necessary to do so to protect SEL, its customers, or the
public.
Unless you instruct us otherwise, SEL may contact you to provide information about
products, services, promotions, contests, or other activities or offerings that may be of
interest to you. You can instruct us whether or not you wish to be contacted by checking
or unchecking the box indicating your preference, as applicable, at the place where your
information is collected, or by clicking here and providing the requested information. In
addition, with each communication you receive from SEL, you will be given the
opportunity to indicate if you do not wish to receive future communications from the
company.
With your consent, SEL may share your personal information with third parties outside
of the Sony group of companies who may want to contact you about products, services
or other offerings that may be of interest to you. Each of these companies may have
their own privacy policies. SEL will seek to obtain your consent at the place where the


information is collected either by an “opt-out” or “opt-in” method, or by other means
(such as an email request). If you consent to receiving communications from any of
these third parties, you will need to communicate with them directly if you later decide
that you no longer wish to receive their communications. If you wish to withdraw your
consent from any further sharing of your personal information with third parties, you may
do so by clicking here and providing the requested information.
For instructions on how to request changes to the personal information you have
provided to SEL, please send an email to: Privacy@am.sony.com or write to us at:
Sony Electronics Inc.
Personal Information Management Office
1 Sony Drive, MD T1-5
Park Ridge, New Jersey 07656.
Use and Disclosure of Anonymous Aggregated Information
SEL may also collect, aggregate and maintain anonymous information about the visitors
to our Web sites, such as visitors hobbies, interests, purchasing habits, music
preferences, and the like. This data can then be used to tailor SEL’s Web site content
and advertising to deliver a better experience for our visitors. SEL may also share such
aggregate information about our visitors with advertisers, business partners, sponsors,
and other third parties; for example, to inform them about the percentage of male/female
visitors or percentage of visitors within a particular age range.
Security
SEL takes great care in maintaining the security of your personal information and in
preventing unauthorized access to it through the use of appropriate technology and
internal procedures. However, SEL does not guarantee that unauthorized access will
never occur.
Notice To/Regarding Children Under the Age of 13
SEL believes that children using the Internet require special protection, and we urge
parents or guardians to explain Internet safety to their children. Parents are urged to
spend time online with their children to become familiar with the types of content
available on the SEL sites and the Internet in general. Control tools are available from
online services and software manufacturers to help create a safer environment for
children.
If you are under 13 years of age, you should not provide any personally identifiable
information (for example, your last name, home address or e-mail address) on these
sites without the knowledge and permission of your parent or guardian. If SEL learns
that you are under 13 years of age, SEL will not maintain or use any personally
identifiable information about you without the verifiable consent of your parent or
guardian, except as allowed by law. This may mean that you will be unable to
participate in some activities on the sites without that verifiable consent. If a child under
13 years of age wishes to participate in any SEL Web site activity, or wishes to take
advantage of a product or service offering, available to children, and to do so
necessitates the furnishing of any of the child’s personal information, please note the
following:
(i)     The names, addresses, telephone numbers, and email addresses of the operators
         collecting or maintaining personal information from children through this Web site


      are:
      Sony Electronics Inc.

      Telephone: 201-930-4800
      e-mail address: Privacy@am.sony.com
(ii)  The types of personal information collected from children may include the name,
      email address, home address, telephone number and/or any other information
      reasonably necessary for the child to participate in a particular activity. This
      information may be collected directly and/or passively (e.g., through a web server
      that automatically recognized and stores information such as a visitor’s IP
      address/domain name combination).
(iii) The information collected may be used for purposes such as fulfillment of a
      requested transaction, record keeping, marketing back to the child, or making it
      publicly available through a chat room or by other means.
(iv)  Unless specific consent is obtained from the child’s parent or guardian, the
      child’s personal information will not be disclosed to third parties who are not
      contractors hired to carry out the internal operations of the Web sites, other than
      as may be required or permitted by law. We have required, or will require, such
      contractors to agree to use personal information of site visitors only for the
      purposes of carrying out these operations and to keep such information
      confidential. A parent or guardian has the option of consenting to the collection
      and use of the child’s personal information without consenting to the disclosure of
      that information to third parties.
(v)    SEL is prohibited from conditioning a child's participation in an activity on the
      child's disclosing more personal information than is reasonably necessary to
      participate in such activity; and
(vi)  A parent can review and have deleted the child's personal information, can
      refuse to permit further collection or use of the child's information, and can
      revoke or limit consents previously given. For instructions on how to do so,
      please send an email to:
      Privacy@am.sony.com or write to us at:
      Sony Electronics Inc.
      Personal Information Management Office
      1 Sony Drive
      MD T1-5
      Park Ridge, New Jersey 07656


Except as permitted by law, before any collection of a child’s personal information takes
place at a Web site directed to children or where SEL is knowingly collecting children’s
personal information, the child will be asked to provide his/her parent’s or guardian's e-
mail address so that SEL can contact the child’s parent or guardian. SEL will then send
an email (the ""Initial Notification"") to the parent/guardian indicating, among other things,
the information that the child is requested to provide, the intended use(s) of the
information and information on how the parent/guardian can, at their election, delete the
child's information from SEL’s database or records. Upon receipt of the Initial
Notification, a parent or guardian may respond back to SEL to grant his/her consent or to
deny consent in which case SEL will delete the parent or guardian’s email address and
any other personal information, if any, previously obtained for securing parental consent.
Upon SEL’s receipt of the parent/guardian consent, SEL will send a confirming email to
the parent/guardian’s email address or take such other action as may be required to
verify the consent.
If SEL desires to use a child’s information for purposes other than that for which the
parent/guardian consent was previously given, SEL will not do so without first getting the
parent/guardian consent.
Consent to Processing:
By providing any personal information to the SEL Sites, all users, including without
limitation users in the member states of the European Union, fully understand and
unambiguously consent to the collection and processing of such information in the
United States of America.
 Policy Governs Use: Changes to Privacy Policy
The terms of this policy will govern the use and any information collected while it is in
place. SEL reserves the right to change this policy at any time, so please re-visit this
page as often as you wish. In case of any material change, we will replace the ""Privacy
Policy"" link on the home page of our sites with a link entitled ""Updated Privacy Policy
dated ____."" Changes to this privacy policy are effective as of the stated ""Last Update
Date” and your continued use of this site on or after the Last Update date will constitute
acceptance of, and agreement to be bound by, those changes.

###  Collection of Information

###  Information You Provide To SCA

In General. While SCA does not generally require that you provide us with personally identifiable information in order to visit and use the SCA Websites, please note that in order to participate in some activities, such as sweepstakes, contests and other promotions (collectively, “Promotions”) and chat rooms or bulletin boards, we may ask you to provide information that could reasonably be used to contact you or to identify you personally (such as first and last name, e-mail address, mailing address, telephone number or possibly, a picture) (""Personal Information""). We may also ask you to provide other information about yourself, such as demographic information (such as gender, geographic region, age, etc.) or certain information about your preferences and interests.  If you choose not to provide such Personal Information or other information to us, you may not be able to participate in certain activities we offer. If we combine demographic or other information we collect about you with Personal Information about you, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information.

Individuals Under 13. The SCA Websites are open to all individuals, though some Promotions may have age restrictions. We do not knowingly collect or permit the collection, storage or use of any Personal Information from anyone under 13. If you are a parent or guardian who knows or has discovered that your child under the age of 13 has submitted his or her Personal Information or other information without your consent, permission or authorization, upon request, we will promptly: (a) provide direct notice to you indicating what, if any, Personal Information of your child has been collected and how it has been used and/or disclosed; (b) remove your child’s Personal Information or other information from our database, cease the use of such information and direct any other party with access to such information to do the same; and (c) by notice to you, confirm compliance with the foregoing.

For Promotions. We may offer opportunities to enter into Promotions that we offer, on our own or jointly with a third party. Such Promotions may require registration and the disclosure of both Personal Information and non-Personal Information. In the event that a Promotion is offered jointly with a third party, as a result of your participation in such Promotion, your Personal Information and non-Personal Information may be shared with such third party, which sharing we will disclose to you at the time you provide your information.  By entering into a Promotion, you are agreeing to the official rules that govern that Promotion, which may contain specific requirements of you, including, except where prohibited by law, allowing the sponsor and/or other third parties connected to the Promotion to use your name, voice and/or likeness in advertising and marketing materials. Therefore, always carefully read the rules of the Promotion before entering.

###  Information SCA Collects Automatically

In addition to any Personal Information or other information that you choose to provide to us via the SCA Websites, whenever you visit or interact with the SCA Websites, SCA automatically collects certain information such as your IP address and/or another unique identifier (""Device Identifier"") for the computer, mobile device, technology or other device (""Device"") you use to access the SCA Websites and any referring website. (A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device when you access a website or its servers. Our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier.) Some mobile service providers may also provide us or our third-party service providers with information regarding the physical location of the Device used to access the Websites.

In addition, SCA, as well as certain third-party analytics and other service providers, may use a variety of technologies that automatically or passively collect information about how you use the SCA Websites (""Usage Information""). Usage Information may include, in part, browser type, operating system, the page served, the time at which a page was accessed and/or the time spent on a page, and the preceding pages views. Usage Information is generally non-identifying, but if SCA associates it with you as a specific and identifiable person, we will treat it as Personal Information.

###  Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies.

The technologies used on the SCA Websites to collect Usage Information, including Device Identifiers, may include:

Cookies. ""Cookies"" (which may be html files, Flash files or other technology) are small text files that help store user preferences and activity.  A Cookie is placed on a Device when it is used to visit the SCA Websites or otherwise access our online offerings. Cookies may be used for many purposes, such as remembering you and your preferences, tracking your visits to our web pages and customizing your SCA Website experience. If you choose to disable cookies on your Device, some features of our Websites and our online offerings may not function properly.

Web Beacons. “Web beacons” (also known as image tags, pixel tags, GIFS or web bugs) are small pieces of code used to collect advertising data, such as counting page views, promotion views or advertising responses. Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to the SCA Websites, to monitor how users navigate the SCA Websites, to count how many sent e-mails were actually opened or to determine whether content sent was actually viewed.

Embedded Scripts. An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the SCA Websites, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Websites, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.

###  Information SCA Receives From Third Parties

SCA may receive information about you from third parties. In addition, if you are on another website and you opt-in to receive information from us, that website will forward to us your e-mail address and other information about you so that we may contact you as requested. We may also supplement the information we collect about you with outside records from third parties in order to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you and to offer you opportunities to purchase products or services that we believe may be of interest to you. When we obtain Personal Information from third parties, we will apply this Privacy Policy to the Personal Information received, unless we have disclosed otherwise.

###  Social Media Applications

Functionality on the SCA Websites may permit interactions between such SCA Websites and a third-party website, such as enabling you to “like” a product or “share” content to third-party websites.  If you choose to “like” or “share” content or to otherwise post information from or via the SCA Websites to a third-party website, feature or application, that information may become public and the third-party web site may have access to information about you and your use of the SCA Websites.

You may also choose to participate in a third party application or feature (such as one of our Facebook applications or a similar application or feature on a third-party website) through which you allow us to collect and share (or the third party to share) information about you, including Personal Information. The third party may allow you to remove the application or feature, in which case we will no longer collect information about you through the application or feature, but we may retain the information previously collected. In addition, we may receive information about you if other users of a third-party website give us access to their profiles and you are one of their “connections,” or if information about you is otherwise accessible through your “connections” web page, profile page, or similar page on a social networking or other third-party website or interactive service.

###  Uses of the Personal Information SCA Collects

SCA will use the information it collects, including your Personal Information:

  * to tailor your experience on the SCA Websites;
  * to determine which products and services we offer may be of interest to you;
  * to provide you with information about Promotions or other offerings that may be of interest to you;
  * to provide you with support and answer questions or other requests; and
  * for other purposes disclosed to you at the time you provide the Personal Information.



We may also use the information we collect to improve the SCA Websites and our products and services, for internal business purposes, and to contact you with regard to your use of the SCA Websites and, in our discretion, changes to any of our policies.

###  When and With Whom SCA May Share Information Collected

Non-Personal Information. We may share non-Personal Information, such as aggregate user statistics, demographic information, and Usage Information with third parties for a variety of purposes, including tailoring promotions, advertising and communications we present to you.

Personal Information. We may also share your Personal Information, as specifically disclosed at the time you provide your Personal Information and in the following circumstances:

###  To Affiliates, Other Sony Companies and Third-Parties.

To Affiliates and Other Sony Companies. SCA may share your Personal Information with companies affiliated with SCA (“Affiliates""), so that those Affiliates can (i) assist us with fulfilling your requests or improving our products, content, services or advertising; and/or (ii) contact you about products, content, services or other offerings that may be of interest to you.  For purposes of this Privacy Policy, Affiliates means Sony Corporation of America, any company with respect to which SCA owns, directly or indirectly, 50% or more of its outstanding shares, and any company with the name ""SONY"" as a part of its trade name.

To Third-Party Service Providers Providing Services On SCA’s Behalf. We may from time to time employ third parties to perform functions on our behalf, and thus, we may also share your Personal Information with third party service providers that assist us with providing content, fulfilling your requests, improving our products, content, services or advertising, or otherwise performing services for SCA. As one example, if you access content or services that are published, developed or supported by an Affiliate or third party, your Personal Information may be shared with that Affiliate or third party for purposes related to that content or those services, including service administration and/or development. Additionally, we may share your information in order to host or operate the SCA Websites, for data analysis purposes, and for the administration of Promotions, such as in connection with winner selection and prize fulfillment.

When You Consent To Have Your Personal Information Shared or Otherwise Request That We Share Your Information. We may offer you the opportunity to consent to the sharing of your information with third parties. Such reasons include, without limitation, so that you are able to receive information and/or marketing offers from third parties. Additionally, you may request, sometimes through your use of an interactive feature or third- party application, that we share Personal Information about you with a third party, and we will typically do so in those circumstances. If you agree or request to have your Personal Information shared (either by opting in, choosing not to opt-out or using a specific feature of the SCA Websites), your Personal Information will be disclosed to the applicable third party(s) and the Personal Information you disclose will be subject to the privacy policy and business practices of such third party(s); therefore, please consult the respective privacy policies of each third party.  If you consent or request to receive communications from third parties, you will need to communicate with them directly if you later decide that you no longer wish to receive their communications.

The provisions above apply to our sharing of Personal Information with Affiliates and third-party service providers.  They do not cover use of Personal Information that those Affiliates and third-party service providers collect directly from you.  Such use of Personal Information is covered by the relevant Affiliate’s and/or third party’s privacy policy and not this Privacy Policy.

Business Transactions. We may share your Personal Information with other entities affiliated with us for internal reasons, primarily for business and operational purposes including any corporate reorganization, restructuring or other corporate change. In addition, SCA or any of its assets, including the SCA Websites, may be sold, or other transactions may occur in which your Personal Information is one of the key business assets in the transaction. In such a case, your Personal Information may be one of the business assets we transfer. Hence, SCA reserves the right to disclose and transfer user information, including Personal Information, in connection with any activity and/or transaction described above.

Legal Protections and Law Enforcement. We may transfer and disclose information, including your Personal Information, Usage Information and Device Identifier (including IP address), to third parties: (i) to comply with legal obligations; (ii) when we believe in good faith that the law requires it; (iii) at the request of governmental authorities conducting an investigation; (iv) to verify or enforce our Terms & Conditions or other applicable policies; (v) to respond to an emergency; or (vi) to otherwise protect the rights, property, safety or security of third parties, visitors to the SCA Websites or the public. We may also use Device Identifiers to identify users, and may do so in cooperation with copyright owners, Internet service providers, wireless service providers or law enforcement agencies, in our discretion. Such disclosures may be carried out without notice to you.

###  Links To and SCA Content On Other Websites

The SCA Websites may contain links to other websites that are operated and controlled by third parties that we do not control. This includes links of advertisers, sponsors and partners that may use our logo(s) as part of a co-branding agreement. In addition, SCA content or widgets may be included on web pages and websites that are not associated with us and over which we have no control. These other websites may send their own cookies to your Device, and they may independently collect data or solicit Personal Information. A link from any SCA Website to any other website does not mean that Sony approves of, endorses, or recommends that website. SCA provides such links for your convenience and is not responsible for the content of any website linked to or from any SCA Website. Moreover, SCA is not responsible for the privacy practices of any third party, and it disclaims all warranties, express or implied, as to the accuracy, legality, reliability, or validity of any content on any other website.

###  Notice to California Residents

Your California Privacy Rights: If you are a California resident, you have the right to receive: (a) information identifying any third party(ies) to whom SCA may have disclosed, within the preceding calendar year, your personal information for that third party’s direct marketing purposes; and (b) a description of the categories of personal information disclosed. To obtain such information free of charge, please write to us at Sony Corporation of America, 550 Madison Avenue, New York, New York 10022, Attn: Legal Department, or submit your request to privacy@sonyusa.com. SCA will respond to these requests within thirty (30) days. Requests that come to SCA by other means may result in a delayed response.

California Online Privacy Protection Act Notice: Some web browsers incorporate a “Do Not Track” feature that signals to websites that you visit that you do not want to have your online activity tracked. How browsers communicate the Do Not Track signal is not yet uniform. For this reason, our Websites do not currently interpret, respond to or alter their practices when they receive Do Not Track signals. Please note that third parties may collect personal information about your online activities over time and across different websites when you visit our website or other online websites and services. To find out more about ""Do Not Track,"" you may wish to visit http://www.allaboutdnt.com.

###  Security and Retention

SCA uses commercially reasonable safeguards to help protect and secure your Personal Information, and we use reasonable efforts to obtain the agreement of our Affiliates and third-party service providers to take steps to protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity of Personal Information we share with them. However, no electronic data transmission or storage of information can be guaranteed to be 100% private and secure. Please be careful to avoid ‘phishing’ scams, where someone may send you an e-mail that looks like it is from SCA asking for your Personal Information. SCA will never request your Personal Information through e-mail.

To help protect you and others, we monitor use of the SCA Websites, and we use the information we collect, including Personal Information, to identify fraudulent activities and transactions; prevent abuse of and investigate and/or seek prosecution for any potential threats to or misuse of the SCA Websites; ensure compliance with the applicable terms of service and this Privacy Policy; investigate violations of or enforce these agreements; and otherwise to protect the rights and property of SCA, its affiliates, partners and customers. Monitoring may result in the collection, recording, and analysis of online activity or communications through the SCA Websites. If you do not consent to these conditions, you must discontinue your use of the SCA Websites.

You understand that any message or information you send to a SCA Website may be read or intercepted by others. SCA does not ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you use the SCA Websites and provide us with your information at your own risk.

###  Consent to Processing

The SCA Websites are operated in the United States. If you are located in the European Union, Canada or elsewhere outside of the United States, please be aware that information we collect will be transferred to and processed in the United States. By using the SCA Websites, or providing us with any information, you fully understand and unambiguously consent to this transfer, processing and storage of your information in the United States, a jurisdiction in which the privacy laws may not be as comprehensive as those in the country where you reside and/or are a citizen.

###  Policy Governs Use: Changes to Privacy Policy

The terms of this Privacy Policy will govern the use of any information collected while it is in place. SCA reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time, without prior notice to you, and any changes will become effective immediately upon posting. Your continued use of the SCA Websites after posting of any changes to this Privacy Policy will constitute acceptance of, and agreement to be bound by, those changes. Thus, please review this Privacy Policy periodically.

### YOUR INFORMATION: WHAT WE COLLECT, HOW WE COLLECT IT, AND HOW IT IS USED

In common with most other websites and on-line services, we collect certain data about your visit to the Rovi Properties. Any data we gather through your use of Rovi Property falls into three categories: (1) personal information that you supply to us, such as information you provide when you register (including your e-mail address), create an account, create a user name, register your device, complete a survey, enter a contest, or purchase products or services; (2) information that is collected as you use Rovi Property that becomes identified with your personal information; and (3) information that does not directly identify you and is collected as you use Rovi Property, including your IP address, and information gathered with the use of a ""cookie"" (cookies are discussed further below), and information related to searches or recommendations on Rovi Property. Such information collected includes, without limitation, which pages and content are browsed, interactions with advertising and content, and other data related to preferences and usage. We use this information including, without limitation, to create new products and services, to better target advertising and content, (on our and our business associates’ websites) to generate statistics, reports and for various analytic purposes.

You may use certain Rovi Property without registering or creating an account. We may nonetheless build a history of your interactions with the Rovi Property even though we don't know who you are.

Regarding Rovi Properties that are products, Rovi may also employ update management software to collect installation and registry information from your computer, including product, version, build, language and original equipment manufacturer. Where you use multiple Rovi Properties, Rovi may combine or link information collected from various Rovi Properties and use it for the purposes outlined in this privacy policy.  


##### Personal information

As is common across websites, to use certain features of Rovi Property we ask you to register, create an account, provide your full name and email address and create a password. Once you have created an account, you will have the option to fill out a form (all or portions of which may be included in your profile). When you create your profile, we collect personal information about you, such as name, address, location, e-mail address, favorite actors, music, etc. which will be stored in order to provide services to you and to conduct activities including, without limitation, using it to process your registration, maintain a profile about you, process your request to receive newsletters and email announcements, or to voluntarily participate in surveys or contests and/or to communicate with you about services and products we think may be of interest to you.

Rovi may allow you to set up profiles that may be viewed by other users of the Rovi Properties. To enrich your profile you may chose to include some personal information in your public profile so that other users can identify you. You should only include information in your public profile that you do not mind making publicly available without restriction.

To process your purchase orders we require your name, billing address, phone number, email address, shipping address, credit card information and credit card security codes. We use this information to process your order and, if any questions arise, to contact you about your order. We may also use it to contact you about other products and services we feel may be of interest to you. In general Rovi will try to email you first but may phone or send an electronic message to you if you have provided these details and you consent to our so doing.

Personal information is also used to provide personalized services to you, such as show tracking and recommendations.

We may provide data about our users, traffic patterns, products, services and site information to third-parties (such as vendors, advertisers and our business associates) ('Third Parties”), but, except as otherwise described in this policy, we will use reasonable efforts to provide it in a form that does not directly identify you.

Any data we gather through your use of Rovi Property falls into three categories: (1) personal information that you supply to us, such as information you provide when you register (including your e-mail address), create an account, create a username, register your device, complete a survey, enter a contest, or purchase products or services or apply for a career; (2) information that is collected as you use Rovi Property that becomes identified with your personal information; and (3) information that does not directly identify you and is collected as you use Rovi Property, including your IP address, and information gathered with the use of a ""cookie"" (cookies are discussed further below), and information related to searches or recommendations on Rovi Property. Such information collected includes, without limitation, which pages and content are browsed, interactions with advertising and content, and other data related to preferences and usage. We use this information including, without limitation, to provide our services to you, create new products and services, to better target advertising and content, (on our and our business associates’ websites) to generate statistics, reports and for various analytic purposes (including combining the data we collect with data from other sources).

You may use certain Rovi Property without registering or creating an account. We may nonetheless build a history of your interactions with the Rovi Property even though we don't know who you are.

Regarding Rovi Properties that are products, Rovi may also employ update management software to collect installation and registry information from your computer, including product, version, build, language and original equipment manufacturer. Where you use multiple Rovi Properties, Rovi may combine or link information collected from various Rovi Properties and use it for the purposes outlined in this privacy policy.  


##### Personal information

As is common across websites, to use certain features of Rovi Property we may ask you to register, create an account, provide your full name and email address and create a password. Once you have created an account, you will have the option to fill out a form (all or portions of which may be included in your profile). When you create your profile, we collect personal information about you, such as name, address, location, e-mail address, favorite actors, music, etc. which will be stored in order to provide services to you and to conduct activities including, without limitation, using it to process your registration, maintain a profile about you, process your request to receive newsletters and email announcements, or to voluntarily participate in surveys or contests and/or to communicate with you about services and products we think may be of interest to you.

If you apply for a career with us we will collect the information you provide to us in any forms you fill in plus your resume (or for example your linked in profile) if you provide that to us. We may also carry out background and other checks, but will only do so with your permission which will be separately requested. If you become an employee then your data will no-longer be subject to this privacy policy but will be subject to certain other policies applicable to our employees. Personal information that you provide to us when applying for a career will be used for the purpose of proceeding with such application and it may be provided to third parties who may carry out recruitment, testing and other recruitment related services for us. These third parties may be based overseas. We may also create anonymous information from such information that you provide to us and used per the paragraph below described  as ‘creation of anonymous data’.

You should not provide us with any ‘sensitive personal data’ through the Rovi Properties.

Rovi may allow you to set up profiles that may be viewed by other users of the Rovi Properties. To enrich your profile you may chose to include some personal information in your public profile so that other users can identify you. You should only include information in your public profile that you do not mind making publicly available without restriction.

To process your purchase orders we require your name, billing address, phone number, email address, shipping address, credit card information and credit card security codes. We use this information to process your order and, if any questions arise, to contact you about your order. We may also use it to contact you about other products and services we feel may be of interest to you. In general Rovi will try to email you first but may phone or send an electronic message to you if you have provided these details and you consent to our so doing.

Personal information is also used to provide personalised services to you, such as show tracking and recommendations.

We may provide data about our users, traffic patterns, products, services and site information to third-parties (such as vendors, advertisers and our business associates) ('Third Parties”), but, except as otherwise described in this policy, we will use reasonable efforts to provide it in a form that does not directly identify you.

Creation of Anonymous Data.                                                             

We may create Anonymous Data records from Personal Data by excluding information (such as your name) that makes the data personally identifiable to you. Once we create Anonymous Data this Anonymous Data is our property. We use this Anonymous Data in many ways including analyzing request and usage patterns, creating reports and performing analytics so that we may enhance the content of our Services, improve Site navigation and provide meaningful analysis of habits, usage, trends, and effectiveness of marketing campaigns etc. as part of our analytics and other services. Company reserves the right to use and disclose Anonymous Data to Third Party Companies in its absolute discretion.

Social Media and Profiles.  
For certain Rovi Properties the information that we may ask you to provide could include name, gender, location, email address, biographical information and the movies and television shows that you like to watch. When you create your profile, you may be asked if you want your profile to be public or private. Unless you state that you want your profile to be private your profile will be available for public viewing.

Public Content.  
Your photos, posts, friends, and other content you post to the Rovi Properties (and your Profile if you designate it as public, including your first name and last initial but excluding any other account registration information) are meant for public consumption. We may display this content on the Rovi Properties and further distribute it to a wider audience through third party sites and services.

Facebook and other Social Networking Sites.  
If you are logged into Facebook or another Social Networking Site (“SNS”) that we support, and you access but are not logged into the Rovi Property, we may receive information from Facebook or the SNS to make it easier for you to create an account on the Rovi Property and to show our relevant content from your Facebook or SNS friends. This information personalizes your experience and helps you create an account (where this facility is available). You may also be able to connect your account on the Rovi Property to your accounts on Facebook or other SNSs, in which case we may collect and store information identifying your account with the third party service. We use this information to help you connect and share public content with your friends and followers.

Material You Choose to Reveal in On-line Fora, Blogs, Message Boards, Chat Rooms or Similar Locations.  
You may be able to post personally information on areas of a Rovi Property that may be viewed by other users or the public, although we recommend that you do not do so. Please note that there are risks, including but not limited to the risk of physical harm, of dealing with strangers, including persons who may be acting under false pretenses. Please choose carefully the information you post on the Rovi Property and that you give to other Rovi Property users. You are discouraged from publicly posting your full name, telephone numbers, street addresses or other information that identifies you or allows strangers to find you or steal your identity. Despite this prohibition, other people’s information may be offensive, harmful or inaccurate, and in some cases will be mislabeled or deceptively labeled.

YOU ASSUME ALL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH DEALING WITH OTHER USERS WITH WHOM YOU COME IN CONTACT THROUGH ROVI PROPERTIES. WE EXPECT THAT YOU WILL USE CAUTION AND COMMON SENSE WHEN USING ROVI PROPERTIES.

","### This Privacy Policy Was Updated 4/20/2017

Your privacy is important to Rockford (""ROCKFORD""). So we’ve developed a Privacy Policy that covers how we collect, use, disclose, transfer, and store your information. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with our privacy practices.

### Collection of Personal Information

You may visit our website and use our iOS or Android apps anonymously, without revealing any personal information. At times, Rockford will request personal information to provide you with a specific product, service, information, or to provide you with a personalized on-line experience.

  * We may collect information such as name, shipping address, billing address, telephone numbers, credit card information and e-mail address.

### Collection of Non-Personal Information

We also collect data in a form that does not permit direct association with any specific individual. We may collect, use, transfer, and disclose non-personal information for any purpose. The following are some examples of non-personal information that we collect and how we may use it:

Aggregated data is considered non‑personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.
  * We may collect and store details of how you use our services, including search queries. This information may be used to improve the relevancy of results provided by our services. Except in limited instances to ensure quality of our services over the Internet, such information will not be associated with your IP address.

Rockford cannot be held responsible for personal information voluntarily disclosed by you to third parties. Please safeguard your personal information.

In this Privacy Policy, “Affiliates” refers to our subsidiaries and entities that Tribune or its subsidiaries operate or have an ownership interest in. 

This Privacy Policy applies only to the information we collect through the websites, mobile applications, electronic devices, kiosks, and all other interactive services (except electronic mail) whereby data is transmitted (hereinafter “the Services”) operated by Tribune Company and its subsidiaries (collectively “we” or “us”) regardless of how you access the Services, unless such website, mobile application, electronic device, kiosk, or other interactive service has a separate Privacy Policy specific to such website, application, device, kiosk, or interactive service. The Policy describes: 

  * The information we collect and how we collect it;
  * What we do with the information we collect;
  * Information sharing and disclosure;
  * How you can access and update your information;
  * How we protect information;
  * Linked sites and advertisements;
  * How to contact us;
  * Your California privacy rights; and
  * Changes to this policy.



The information we collect and how we collect it.

How we collect and store information depends on the websites you visit, the activities in which you participate and the Services you use. You can use some of the Services without providing any information other than that automatically collected as described below. 

We may collect information about you during your use of the Services, including your name, username, password, email address, postal address, phone number, mobile phone number, payment information, gender, birth year, and information you provide or post on our Services or allow us to access when you do certain things, such as:

  * Enter registration information for one or more of our Services;
  * Enter a sweepstakes or contest or register for a promotion;
  * Participate in voting or polling activities;
  * Make a purchase;
  * Request certain features (e.g., newsletters, updates, and other products);
  * Sign up to receive SMS (text message) notifications;
  * Download or use one of our mobile applications;
  * Connect with the Services or otherwise allow us to access certain information about you via a social networking site (“SNS”); or
  * Post user-generated content to any of our websites.



We may collect and store your user ID associated with a SNS account that you use to sign in to your Tribune account or connect or use with the Services. When you sign in to your Tribune account or mobile application with your SNS account information or otherwise connect to your SNS account with the Services, you authorize Tribune to collect, store, and use in accordance with this Privacy Policy any and all information available to Tribune through the SNS interface. 

We may also combine information that we collect from you with information we obtain about you from third parties and Affiliates and information derived from any other subscription, product, or service we provide.

Please be careful and responsible whenever you are online. Should you choose to voluntarily disclose information through the Services, such as via SNSs, on message boards, chat areas or in advertising or notices you post, that information can be viewed publicly and can be collected and used by third parties without our knowledge and may result in unsolicited messages from other individuals or third parties. 

When you use the Services, we use persistent and session cookies and other tracking technologies to: (a) store your username and password; (b) analyze the usage of our sites and services; (c) customize the Services to your preferences; and (d) control the advertising displayed by the Services. We may also use other Internet technologies, such as Flash technologies, Web beacons or pixel tags, and other similar technologies, to deliver or communicate with cookies and track your use of the Services (including to serve you ads when you are on other websites or the Internet when we can access those cookies). We also may include web beacons in e-mail messages or newsletters to determine whether the message has been opened. As we adopt additional technology, we may also gather additional information through other methods.

We use these automated technologies to collect and analyze certain types of information we consider to be non-personal information, including: (a) information related to the devices you use to access or interact with our services, such as: IP addresses, geolocation information (as described further below), unique device identifiers and other information about your mobile phone or other mobile device(s), browser types, browser language; and (b) information related to the ways in which you interact with the Services, such as: referring and exit pages and URLs, platform type, the number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, the date and time you used the Services, and other similar information. We may also capture other data, such as search criteria and results. In some cases, we will associate this information with a unique Tribune identifier (that cannot be used by itself to identify you) for our internal use, in which case your Tribune identifier will be considered Tribune information and the use of it is not covered by this Privacy Policy. 

We may collect different types of information about your location, including general information (e.g., IP address, zip code) and more specific information (e.g., GPS-based functionality on mobile devices used to access the Services), and may use that information to customize the Services with location-based information, advertising, and features. For example, if you provide a zip code that indicates that you live in Chicago, the Services may be customized with Chicago-specific information and advertisements. In order to do this, your location information may be passed along to our Affiliates, agents, vendors or advertisers. If you access the Services through a mobile device and you do not want your device to provide us with location-tracking information, you can disable the GPS or other location-tracking functions on your device, provided your device allows you to do this. See your device manufacturer’s instructions for further details.

Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can modify your browser setting to decline cookies by visiting the Help portion of your browser’s toolbar. If you choose to decline cookies, please note that you may not be able to sign in, customize, or use some of the interactive features of the Services. Flash cookies operate differently than browser cookies, and cookie management tools available in a web browser will not remove flash cookies. To learn more about how to manage flash cookies, you can visit the Adobe website and make changes at the Global Privacy Settings Panel.

Third parties whose products or services are accessible or advertised via the Services may also place cookies on your browser to collect non-personal information about your use of the Services. We also allow other third parties (e.g., ad networks and ad servers) to serve ads to you on the Services, and to access their own cookies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the Services. We neither have access to, nor does this Policy govern, the use of cookies that may be placed on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the Services by non-affiliated, third-party ad technology, ad servers or ad networks. Those parties that use cookies may offer you a way to opt out of ad targeting. If you would like more information about this practice and how to control how this information may used by these third-party companies, please visit the Network Advertising Initiative’s website or the Digital Advertising Alliance’s website.

What we do with the information we collect.

We use the information that we collect for the following purposes:

  * For the purposes for which you provided it;
  * To send you information about your relationship or transactions with us;
  * To send you alerts or other communications via SMS messages or other media or networks;
  * To notify you about new features of the Services, special events, or products, services, and special offers;
  * To administer sweepstakes and contests;
  * To process and respond to your inquiries;
  * To contact you with information that we believe will be of interest to you;
  * To attribute content that you make available through the Services;
  * To generate and review reports and data about our user base and Service usage patterns;
  * To analyze the accuracy, effectiveness, usability, or popularity of the Services;
  * To improve the content and features of the Services or develop new Services;
  * To allow us to personalize the content and advertising that you see on the Services;
  * To enforce the legal terms that govern your use of the Services; and
  * To administer and troubleshoot the Services.



The Services are supported by advertising revenue. We will send you commercial email on behalf of ourselves, our Affiliates, and advertisers. Each such email we send you will have an opt-out that you can use to stop receiving such communications. 

We may aggregate and/or anonymize information collected by the Services or via other means so that the information does not identify you. Our use and disclosure of aggregated, anonymized, and other non-personal information is not subject to any restrictions under this Privacy Policy, and we may disclose it to others without limitation for any purpose.

Information sharing and disclosure.

We will make your information available to other companies, websites, applications or people in the circumstances described below:

  * We may rent, sell, or share your information with non-affiliated third parties: (a) in order to provide services or products that you have requested; (b) when we have your permission; or (c) as described in this Privacy Policy.
  * We may share your information with any Affiliate or agent of Tribune Company in order to provide the Services or advertising or to communicate with you on our behalf.
  * When you sign up to participate in a contest or sweepstakes, your information may also be provided to our sweepstakes or contest advertisers, operators, or sponsors and the use of that information will be also governed by those advertisers’, operators’, or sponsors’ privacy policies or practices.
  * We may disclose your information in response to any subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process we receive, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or to defend against legal claims.
  * We may share your information with third-party advertisers and advertising networks or others with which we have a contractual relationship.
  * We may disclose your information when we believe it appropriate in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding possible illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of the Terms of Service for the Services you accessed, and/or to protect our rights and property.



As we continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, merge or partner with other companies or businesses. In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets. 

How you can access and update your information.

To ensure that you have some control over the information we have about you, you may review and update certain user profile information by logging in to the relevant portions of the Services where such information may be updated (may be available on some Services and not others) or by contacting us at privacy@tribune.com.

How we protect information.

We have implemented reasonable administrative, technical, and physical security measures to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of your information. Despite our best efforts, however, no security measures are completely impenetrable. 

Linked sites and advertisements.

The Services may contain links to third-party websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of those third-party websites. 

We have relationships with third-party providers to provide content, products, services, and functionality through the Services. When you visit sites or use any Services provided in conjunction with one or more of these third-party providers and the brands of those providers appear on the site or Services in connection with such content, products, services, or functionality, we may share any information you provide or that is collected during your use of those Services with those providers. In some cases, the provider may collect information from you directly, in which case the provider’s privacy policy (which may differ from this Privacy Policy) would apply. If you have any questions regarding the privacy policy of any of our providers, you should contact the provider directly for more information. 

How to contact us.

If you have any questions, comments, or concerns regarding our Privacy Policy or practices, please send an email to privacy@tribune.com.

Your California privacy rights.

California law permits users who are California residents to request and obtain from us once a year, free of charge, a list of the third parties to whom we have disclosed their personal information (if any) for their direct marketing purposes in the prior calendar year, as well as the type of personal information disclosed to those parties. If you are a California resident and would like to request this information, please submit your request in an email to privacy@tribune.com. 

Changes to this policy.

Tribune Company reserves the right to change this policy at any time. Please check this page periodically for changes. Your continued use of the Services following the posting of changes to this policy will mean you accept those changes.

## Privacy Regarding Clients of Revenue Science’s Services

This document is intended to inform you, the end user, about how Revenue Science handles information we process on behalf of our Web site owners, advertisers, and service providers who use our services (our “Clients”) as part of our data analytics services and information we process for our network advertising services. This document also explains our own practices for our corporate Web site.

Revenue Science reserves the right to change how we handle information we process on behalf of our Clients as well as our own practices in regard to Revenue Science’s services or corporate Web site. We will update this document to reflect any changes and will state the date it was last updated.

### What does Revenue Science do?

We provide data analysis and audience segmentation services based on information provided by our Clients regarding their customer interactions, including those on the Client’s Web site or online advertisements. We create usage/behavior/interest-based categories called “segments.” Segments are unique groups of users that are created using Client-defined criteria that enable the Client to selectively serve targeted advertisements and otherwise profile users of that Client’s site(s) or advertisements. We are an outsource solution for what many companies traditionally have done internally, including traffic pattern and behavioral trend evaluations to enhance the usefulness and marketing power of their sites and services. Companies outsource these services to us to reduce cost, increase efficiencies, and decrease turnaround time.

We also provide targeting advertising services using non-personal information that is gathered across multiple, unaffiliated Web sites that use our network. Much like our data analytic services provided for specific Web sites, we create network segments that are used to serve targeted advertisements and profile users in our network.

### What information do we collect for our Clients and how do we use it for our data analytics services?

Our Clients collect information about their customer interactions using cookies, action tags, and other methods. Cookies are small text files that identify your computer. Web site owners use cookies to, among other things, monitor site usage, customize site features, identify a user’s computer operating system and browser, and complete transactions. An action tag (also known as a “clear gif” or “Web beacon”) is a small, graphic image on a Web page that is designed to allow the site owner or a third party to monitor who is visiting a site by collecting the IP address of the computer that the tag is sent to, the URL of the page the tag comes from, and the time it was viewed. Tags also may be associated with cookie information.

A Client may provide information that it collects, including personally identifiable information, to Revenue Science. We also may collect data on behalf of a Client using tags. Information that we collect and compile directly from users includes “clickstream” data such as behavioral data, IP addresses, log files, and other traffic data. We do not collect any personally identifiable information directly from any user, whether using cookies or action tags. As part of our analytics and segmentation services, we may place a cookie on your browser when you visit the Client’s Web site or view an advertisement of the Client.

We use data provided by the Client, as well as data that we collect on behalf of the Client, only to create segments and reports for the Client. Additionally, we make information that we collect for or receive from a particular Client available only to that Client.

We may provide our analytic or segmentation services to Clients that are network advertisers or service providers. These Clients may use a process whereby data is collected over time and across the Internet to determine or predict user characteristics, behavior, or preferences typically for use in ad delivery (called “Online Preference Marketing” [“OPM”]). On behalf of and at the direction of an OPM Client, we may collect non-personal information that the Client may use for OPM purposes on behalf of its customers, including advertisers and Web site owners. OPM Clients are responsible for notifying you of these collection practices and making opt-out procedures available (if any).

A Client may correlate or merge information that we report to it with personal information already collected or accessible by that Client. On behalf of a Client, we may correlate or merge personal information provided by the Client with non-personal information that we collect for that Client. Our Clients are responsible for notifying you whether they correlate or merge personal information to non-personal information that they collect or that we or any other third party collects on their behalf.

Revenue Science firmly supports and encourages our Clients to adopt privacy policies that fully inform the Client’s customers or users about the Client’s information collection practices and use of Revenue Science’s services. You should familiarize yourself with the privacy practices of any Web site you visit to understand what information the site collects, how the information is used, what choices you have, how to access the information, and how it is safeguarded.

### Do we disclose or permit access to our Client’s information?

We keep all data that we receive from and store for our Clients strictly confidential. We are contractually obligated to maintain such confidentiality and we hold our vendors and subcontractors to the same standards whenever they provide services related to the Client’s information. We do not permit access to the information except as directed by our Client.

### What information do we collect and how do we use it for our network advertising services?

Separate from our data analytics services, we provide OPM or network advertising services. For these services, we use a process, whereby data is collected over time and across the Internet to determine or predict user characteristics, behavior, or preferences typically for use in ad delivery. Our Web tags, beacons, or cookies may collect non-personal information that may used for OPM purposes on behalf of our customers, including advertisers and Web site owners. Our systems are designed not to collect, process, or store personal information.

As part of Revenue Science’s commitment to respect privacy concerns and implement industry-recognized standards, Revenue Science is a member of the NAI. RSI complies with the NAI’s Self-Regulatory Principles which are designed to inform consumers about data collection and advertising practices across multiple Web sites and provide the ability to opt out. For more information about OPM and network advertising, please visit the NAI Web site at http://www.networkadvertising.org.

### Do we disclose or permit access to information that we collect for our network services?

No. The user information that we collect to create segments and profile information for our network service is not shared with any third party. To provide our network advertising services, we do enable our customers to customize the segments and other user characteristics that they will use to serve and deliver advertisements. Our network advertising customers are contractually prohibited from using any network segment information to correlate it to or merge it with information that they may collect, process, or store in connection with their site, including personal information except in compliance with the applicable Self-Regulatory NAI Principles, and such customer's privacy policy.

### Do I have the ability not to be identified for Revenue Science’s network advertising services?

Yes. If you do not want your browser to be identified and used for network advertising (OPM) purposes, you may visit http://www.networkadvertising.org for information on how to obtain an “opt-out cookie” to prevent any data from being associated with your browser. Please note that if you elect to opt out, the cookie associated with your browser will be associated with a “blank” or “generic” cookie. Therefore, advertisements that may be served to you on Web sites using our services may repeat and may not be targeted to your interests. Click here for instructions on how to opt out of Revenue Science’s network advertising services.

### Do we have a “P3P” policy?

Yes, Revenue Science also subscribes to a P3P policy, which may be viewed in plain text by accessing the “Privacy Report” in your browser. To the extent that there is any inconsistency between the machine-readable P3P policy and this privacy statement, this privacy statement governs.

### How do we store information?

All information that is provided by our Clients is stored in a database unique to each Client. We do not commingle or share data between or among our Clients. Revenue Science takes reasonable steps to assure that all Client information sent to us from our Clients is secured from unauthorized interception and to protect it from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction in storage while under our control. While we have taken efforts to guard information, we cannot guarantee that it will not be disclosed or accessed by accidental circumstances or by the unauthorized acts of others.

### Do we have a mechanism to address complaints about the handling of information that we collect?

Revenue Science, Inc. participates in the EU Safe Harbor framework as set forth by the United States Department of Commerce. As part of our participation in the safe harbor, we have agreed to dispute resolution by TRUSTe relating to compliance with our privacy statement. If you have any complaints regarding our compliance with the Safe Harbor you should first contact us by e-mail at privacy@revenuescience.com.

If contacting us does not resolve your complaint, you may raise your complaint with TRUSTe by Internet at http://www.truste.org/users/users_watchdog_intro.html, fax at 408-494-4960, or mail at WatchDog Complaints, TRUSTe, 685 Market Street, Suite 560, San Francisco, CA, USA 94105. If you are faxing or mailing TRUSTe to lodge a complaint, you must include the following information: the name of company, the alleged privacy violation, your contact information, and whether you would like the particulars of your complaint shared with the company. For information about TRUSTe or the operation of TRUSTe’s dispute resolution process, see http://www.truste.org/users/users_watchdog_intro.html or request this information from TRUSTe at any of the addresses listed above. The TRUSTe dispute resolution process shall be conducted in English.

If you have questions regarding our compliance with the NAI Self-Regulatory Principles, NAI and its members have engaged TRUSTe to create and manage an independent program for the purpose of ensuring that the NAI members like RSI comply with the NAI Self-Regulatory Principles. Please refer to the NAI site for more information at http://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/enforcement.asp.

### What information is collected from the Revenue Science corporate Web site and how is it used?

Revenue Science’s Clients are businesses, not individuals, and our corporate Web site collects contact information from our Clients and prospective Clients who request information or services from Revenue Science. To the extent that any personal contact information is collected through our Web site, (i) we use this contact information to respond to requests for information about our products and services, to provide access to certain services, and for registration for events and seminars, and (ii) we will post a notice 30 days in advance where the information is collected on our Web site to notify our Clients of any material change in the use of this contact information. Clients and prospective Clients who have provided contact information through the Revenue Science corporate Web site may e-mail Revenue Science at info@revenuescience.com to update their contact information.

### Does Revenue Science use cookies, log file analysis, or tagging technology on its corporate Web site?

Revenue Science’s corporate Web site uses cookies to track user traffic patterns. If you prefer not to receive cookies, you can set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies and refuse the cookie when your browser alerts you to its presence. You can also refuse all cookies, whether from us or one of our Clients, by turning them off in your browser. Revenue Science’s corporate Web site may also use analytic tools for log file analysis or to analyze data from tagging technologies. This analysis may include the specific traffic patterns of our Clients and prospective Clients who have submitted contact information.

### Legal Disclaimer

We may release personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law (e.g., legal process or a statutory authorization); to enforce or apply our customer agreements; to initiate, render, bill, and collect for services; to protect our rights or property, or to protect users of those services from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of, or subscription to, such services; or if we reasonably believe that an emergency involving immediate danger of death or serious physical injury to any person requires disclosure of communications or justifies disclosure of information without delay.

The statements in this Privacy Policy generally about our collection and use of Personal Information also apply to our treatment of personal information from children under the age of thirteen, with the added protection of the special rules that follow. We encourage parents of children under 13 to regularly check and monitor their children's use of e-mail and other activities on line.  
Although this Site is not targeting children under the age of 13, all Smart Balance web sites are designed to comply with the requirements of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and Children's Advertising Review Unit (CARU) guidelines for web sites gathering identifiable information from children (under age 13). Consistent with these requirements and guidelines, and provided that we have been given accurate information by the child when asked, we do NOT:  
• collect personally identifiable off-line contact information without prior parental consent;  
• distribute personally identifiable information to third parties without prior parental consent;  
• ask children to divulge more information than is needed to participate in the activity;  
• use or disclose online contact information without prior parental consent or parental notification, which will include an opportunity for the parent to prevent use of the information and participation in the activity. Without prior parental consent, online information will only be used to respond directly to the child's request and will not be used for other purposes without prior parental consent; or  
• enable children to publicly post or otherwise distribute personally identifiable contact information without prior parental consent.  
Parents can always ask to review any Personal Information about their child that may have been collected at one of our sites, have us delete any such Personal Information, and/or instruct us not to collect or use such Personal Information about their child in the future. To do so, simply contact us following the procedure outlined below in the ""Contact Information"" section.  
If we change the kinds of information we collect, change how we use the information collected or offer the information to new and different third parties, we will send a new notice and request for parental consent.

Security of Information

We take reasonable precautions to keep your Personal Information secure. All personally identifiable information is subject to restricted access in an effort to prevent unauthorized access, modification or misuse. Notwithstanding our efforts, the Internet and world wide web have inherent security risks. We cannot promise or guaranty, and you should not expect, that Personal Information, personal searches, and other communications will always remain secure. You should take care with regard to how you handle and disclose Personal Information. 

How You May Access and Change Certain Information That We Collect.

In those cases, you may have to directly contact those third parties and follow their steps to opt-out of receiving their communications.

CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THIS SITE

Thank you for visiting our smartbalance.com website (“Site”) and reviewing our privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”). Boulder Brands, Inc. and its operating subsidiary, GFA Brands, Inc. (together, “we,” “us,” “our,” or “Smart Balance”) care about your privacy. This Privacy Policy outlines the type of Personal Information that is collected by Smart Balance from consumers and how we use and protect it. This Privacy Policy also tells you what to do if you do not want your Personal Information used for marketing purposes, and how you can change information you have already provided to us. This Privacy Policy applies to this Site. It does not apply to banners, sweepstakes or promotions sponsored by third parties in which Smart Balance participates.

Your Consent to This Privacy Policy

By providing Smart Balance with Personal Information, you acknowledge that you agree with the terms of our current Privacy Policy as posted here. If you do not agree with any term in this Privacy Policy, please do not provide any Personal Information through this Site.

If you choose not to provide Personal Information, you may not be able to do certain things, like access particular areas of our websites, enter sweepstakes or contests, request samples, or send us e-mail.

Collection of Personal Information

As used in this Privacy Policy, ""Personal Information"" means personally identifiable information such as your name, street address, telephone number, credit card information, birth date, gender, username or screen name, photograph, and email address. 

When you provide us with Personal Information, you are authorizing us to use that information in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy, which includes your right to limit our use of your Personal Information (see Contact Information). 

We may also collect Personal Information from you about a third party (e.g., a website might allow you to send an electronic ""post card"" to a friend, in which case we will need that person's name and e-mail address). Please note that we use such information only for the specified purpose (e.g., to mail the post card) and we will not contact the third party again unless and until the third party contacts us.

How We Use Your Information

When you supply us with your Personal Information we will use it for the express purpose for which it was collected (e.g., to enter you in a sweepstakes or to send you a sample), and we also may make use of such Personal Information as described below. Personal Information collected as a result of your use of this Site may be used by the brand responsible for the Site or promotion, as well as by our other brands, to contact you regarding other products and services which may be of interest to you (including those we may offer jointly with other companies). At any time, however, you may opt out of such contact. (See Contact Information) 

We may share your Personal Information with third-party service providers that assist us in maintaining, operating and improving this Site. For example, at times we may retain third parties to analyze data we collect, including Personal Information, to help us improve our products and our web sites. In addition, if you order a product or service from us, we may provide Personal Information to suppliers and other third parties to enable delivery of such product or service. These third parties, including suppliers, are not authorized by us to use your Personal Information in any other way. 

We may supplement the information that you provide to us with other information that we receive from third parties. We do this for marketing purposes in order to provide the most appropriate products and services to meet your needs. 

We may also transfer, sell or assign your Personal Information to any entity to which we divest all or a portion of our business (for example, in connection with our sale of a brand), to the extent that you provided such information to the specific portion of our business (or brand) that is being divested, or otherwise in connection with a merger, consolidation, change in control, reorganization or liquidation of all or a portion of our business.  
Finally, please note that we will release your Personal Information if required to do so to protect our business interests, to comply with law enforcement, or in response to a search warrant, subpoena or court order.

This information does not identify you personally. We automatically collect and store only the following information about your visit:

Secure Shopping

When our order form, log-in page, and/or registration page asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL.

In addition, VeriSign is used as our certifying authority. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, in normal non-secure use. While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information.

Consent to Smarterer Processing Information About You. The information you provide to Smarterer may reveal, or allow others to identify, your nationality, ethnic origin, religion, gender, age, geography, or other aspects of your private life. By providing information to us for the purposes of creating your User account or adding any additional details to your Smarterer profile, you are expressly and voluntarily accepting the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy and Smarterer's User Agreement that allow Smarterer to process information about you. Supplying information to Smarterer, including any information deemed ""sensitive"" by applicable law, is entirely voluntary on your part. You have the right to withdraw your consent to Smarterer's collection and processing of your information at any time, in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy and the User Agreement, by changing your profile or by closing your account, but please note that your withdrawal of consent will not be retroactive, and that information already provided to Smarterer may still be publicly available and/or used by, licensed to or owned by Smarterer pursuant to Section 2 of the User Agreement.

Smarterer Communications. As described in the User Agreement, we will communicate with you through email and notices posted on the Smarterer website or through other means available through the service, including mobile text messages. We may send you a series of emails that help inform new Users about the features of the Services, and we will also send you service messages relating to the functioning of the Services. We may also send you messages with promotional information directly or on behalf of our partners, unless you have opted out of receiving promotional information.

Also, if we send communications to you via the carrier service with which you have a mobile communications subscription or otherwise have access, you understand you will pay any service fees associated with your receipt of messages on your mobile device (including text messaging charges).

Customized Content. We use information provided to us (or to third parties with whom it offers combined services) to customize your experience on our website. For example, when you login to your account, we will display information about new tests or upgrades to prior tests we think may interest you.

Sharing Information with Third Parties. Smarterer does not sell, rent, or otherwise provide your personally identifiable information to third parties for marketing purposes. However, please note that all profile information is available to the public, meaning a User's profile may be published to the public internet. This public profile is what search engines will display when someone searches for your name. Smarterer does not warrant how often third-party search engines will update their caches, which may contain old public profile information. We may provide aggregated anonymous data about the usage of the Services to third parties for purposes that we deem, in our sole discretion, to be appropriate, including to prospective advertisers on Smarterer.

Working with Third Parties to Offer Services. We collaborate with third parties to offer services and functionality using Smarterer developer tools such as our application programming interfaces (""APIs""). These third parties are either partners (""Smarterer Partners"") with whom we have negotiated an agreement to provide services (""Combined Services""), or developers (""Platform Developers"") who have agreed to our API terms in our developer signup flow to build applications (""Platform Applications""). Both the negotiated agreements and our API terms and conditions contain restrictions on access, storage and use of your information. If you choose to use Combined Services or a Platform Application, you may be asked to confirm acceptance of the privacy policy and/or user agreement of the Smarterer Partner or Platform Developer, which have not necessarily been reviewed or approved by Smarterer. It is your choice whether or not to make use of Combined Services or Platform Applications and whether to proceed under any third party terms. Also, despite our agreements and technical steps taken to restrict access to and avoid possible misuse of information we may not screen or audit all Combined Services or Platform Applications. We also cannot guarantee that any Smarterer Partner or Platform Developer will abide by our agreement. You agree that your use of Combined Services or Platform Applications is on an ""as is"" basis and without any warranty. If you or other Users of Smarterer use or interact with any Combined Service or Platform Application, the Smarterer Partner or Platform Developer may access and share certain information about you with others, such as your profile information. To report any suspected misuse of information, contact Smarterer's customer service. Smarterer is not responsible for your use of or inability to use any Combined Service or Platform Application, including the content, accuracy, or reliability of applications and the privacy practices or other policies of Smarterer Partners or Platform Developers.

Compliance with Legal Process. It is possible that we may need to disclose personal information, profile information and/or information about your activities as a Smarterer User when required by subpoena or other legal process, or if Smarterer has a good faith belief that disclosure is necessary to (a) investigate, prevent or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities or to assist government enforcement agencies; (b) to enforce the User Agreement, to investigate and defend ourselves against any third party claims or allegations, or to protect the security or integrity of our site; and/or (c) to exercise or protect the rights, property or personal safety of Smarterer, our Users, employees, or others.

Disclosures to others.We may also disclose your personal information and other information you provide to another third party as part of a reorganization or a sale of the assets of Smarterer Corporation, a subsidiary or division. Any third party to which Smarterer transfers or sells Smarterer's assets will have the right to continue to use the personal and other information that you provide to us.

###### Your information choices.

Accessing and Changing Your Account Information. You can review the personal information you provided to us or to the settings for your Smarterer account including your email and contact preferences, at any time by logging in to your account on the Smarterer website. Please be aware that even after your request for a change is processed, Smarterer may, for a time, retain residual information about you in its backup and/or archival copies of its database. 

Closing Your Account. You can close your account through the Smarterer customer service site. If you close your account, we have no obligation to retain your information, and may delete any or all of your account information without liability. We may retain certain data contributed by you if Smarterer believes it may be necessary to prevent fraud or future abuse, or for legitimate business purposes, such as analysis of aggregated, non-personally identifiable data, account recovery, or if required by law. Smarterer may also retain and use your information if necessary to provide the Services to other Users. For example, just as an email you may send to another person through an email service provider resides in that person's inbox even after you delete it from your sent files or close your account, test results you have taken on Smarterer may remain visible to others after you have closed your account. Similarly, other information you have shared with others, or that other Users have copied, may also remain visible. Smarterer disclaims any liability in relation to the deletion or retention (subject to the terms herein) of information or any obligation not to delete the information. Smarterer does not control when search engines update their cache, which may contain certain public profile information that has since been removed from Smarterer's publicly viewable database. Users should carefully review Section 2 of the User Agreement for additional information about licensing and ownership of personal information.

Memorializing Accounts. If we learn that a User is deceased, we may memorialize the User's account. In these cases we may restrict profile access and close an account if we receive a formal request from the User's next of kin or other proper legal request to do so. 

###### Your obligations.

As a User, you have certain obligations to other Users. Some of these obligations are imposed by applicable law and regulations, and others have become commonplace in communities such as Smarterer:

  * You must, at all times, abide by the terms and conditions of the then-current Privacy Policy and User Agreement. This includes respecting all intellectual property rights that may belong to third parties (such as trademarks or photographs).
  * You must not download or otherwise disseminate any information that may be deemed to be injurious, violent, offensive, racist or xenophobic, or which may otherwise violate the purpose and spirit of Smarterer and its community of Users.
  * You must not provide to Smarterer and/or other Users information that you believe might be injurious or detrimental to your person.
  * You must keep your username and password confidential and not share it with others.
  * Any violation of these guidelines may lead to the restriction, suspension or termination of your account at the sole discretion of Smarterer.



###### Important information.

Using the Smarterer Services after a notice of changes has been sent to you or published on our site shall constitute consent to the changed terms or practices.

By registering your account with Smarterer, you voluntarily and willingly provide us certain information, including personally identifiable information, which we collect in order to provide the Services. If you have any hesitation about providing information to us and/or having your information displayed on the Smarterer website or otherwise used in any manner permitted in this Privacy Policy, the applicable User Agreement and the Community Guidelines, you should not become a member of the Smarterer community; and, if you are already a member, you should close your account. 

We collect your personal information in the following ways: 

  * Registration Information. All Users must register with us by providing a username (usually your email address) and valid password. Enterprise Users may use Single Sign-On (""SSO"") if available through their Enterprise. This information may be referred to as your ""Registration Information."" If choosing a password, you should choose one that is known only by you. You acknowledge that this information is personal to you, and by creating an account on Smarterer, you allow others, including Smarterer, to identify you through your username. 
  * Profile Information. If you are a Consumer User, you may provide additional information in the Profile section such as your name, organization, location, photo, description, or links to external sites. This information, along with your Registration Information may be referred to as your ""Profile Information."" Providing additional information about yourself beyond what is minimally required at registration is entirely up to you. Any information you provide at registration or in the Profile section may be used by Smarterer as described in the Consumer-Level User Agreement and this Privacy Policy. We do not collect Profile Information from Enterprise Users. If you are a test-taker, we may collect directly from you demographic data such as your age, ethnicity, and race. We use this demographic data to identify and remove bias from our tests and to otherwise evaluate and improve our tests and do not share such data without anyone outside Smarterer in any way that could identify you personally. 
  * Test and Scoring Information. Once you become a User, you may use the Services to take tests as often as you would like or as requested by your Enterprise. If you are a Consumer User, the tests you take, and your scores, are private and we will only share them with people you instruct us to share them with. If you are a test-taker within an Enterprise, we only share the tests with the administrators in your Enterprise. You may access your test scores upon request to us at info@smarterer.com. 
  * Test Questions. Once you become a User, you may also have the option to contribute test questions on subject matters of your choosing. If you are a Consumer User, these questions may be made public and used by Smarterer, with or without attribution to you, at its discretion, and you understand and agree that, by writing and posting a Test Question you are consenting to Smarterer making the Test Question public and recognizing you as the author of the Test Question. If you are an Enterprise User, these questions may be used by other users within your Enterprise, with or without attribution to you, and you understand and agree that, by writing and posting a Test Question you consent to the Test Question being used within your Enterprise. 



The Test Questions, Testing and Scoring Information and any other ideas, concepts, responses to questions or queries or other techniques, data or information, including any modifications, enhancements or derivative works, contributed by you relating to the activities on the website or otherwise relating to the Services (not otherwise included under the definition of Profile Information) may be referred to as ""User-Generated Content."" 

  * Site Usage. We may collect information about how you use certain features and functionality of Smarterer, interact with third party Applications, or participate in research initiatives like polling and surveys on Smarterer. 
  * Cookies. Like most websites, we use cookies and web log files to track site usage and trends, to improve the quality of our service, to customize your experience on Smarterer, as well as to deliver advertising off the Smarterer site. A cookie is a tiny data file that resides on your computer, mobile phone, or other device, and allows us to recognize you as a User when you return to the website using the same computer and web browser. You can remove or block cookies using the settings in your browser, but in some cases that may impact your ability to use Smarterer. One type of cookie, known as a ""persistent"" cookie, is set once you've logged in to your Smarterer account. The next time you visit the Smarterer website, the persistent cookie will allow us to recognize you as an existing User so you will not need to log in before using the Services. Another type of cookie, called a ""session"" cookie, is used to identify a particular visit to the Smarterer website. Session cookies expire after a short time or when you close your web browser. In the course of optimizing the Services to our Users, we may allow authorized third parties to place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser. Any information provided to third parties through cookies will not be personally identifiable but may provide general segment information (e.g., your industry or geography, career field, or information about your professional or educational background) for greater customization of your user experience. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. We will respect your choices relating to on-line tracking, whether you choose to reject or delete individual cookies or set your web browser to reject cookies and other tracking technology. Smarterer does not store unencrypted personally identifiable information in the cookies. 
  * Advertising and Web Beacons. To support the Services we provide, we may serve our own advertisements, which will be targeted and served by both Smarterer and other companies, called ad networks. Ad networks include third party ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology vendors and research firms. Smarterer does not provide personally identifiable information to any third party ad network. 
  * Log files, IP addresses and information about your computer and mobile device. Due to the communications standards on the internet, when you visit the Smarterer website we automatically receive the URL of the site from which you came and the site to which you are going when you leave Smarterer. Smarterer also receives the internet protocol (""IP"") address of your computer (or the proxy server you use to access the World Wide Web), your computer operating system and type of web browser you are using, email patterns, mobile device operating system (if you are accessing Smarterer using a mobile device), as well as the name of your ISP or your mobile carrier. We use this information to analyze overall trends to help improve the service. The linkage between your IP address and your personally identifiable information is not shared with third parties without your permission, except as described in ""Compliance with Legal Process"", below. 
  * Linked Accounts. If you link your Smarterer account to another account or service, or use other, third-party sites or services in conjunction with your Smarterer account, we may collect information related to your use of third party sites and services accessed through Smarterer or when you access Smarterer through a third-party site or service.  When you access your account via a third party service, you are granting the third party site or service permission to access the information in your account (including your Profile Information and User-Generated Content).

The information you provide to Smarterer may reveal, or allow others to identify, your nationality, ethnic origin, religion, gender, age, geography, or other aspects of your private life. By providing information to us for the purposes of creating your User account or adding any additional details to your Smarterer profile, you are expressly and voluntarily accepting the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy and the applicable User Agreement that allow Smarterer to process information about you. Supplying information to Smarterer, including any information deemed ""sensitive"" by applicable law, is entirely voluntary on your part. You have the right to withdraw your consent to Smarterer's collection and processing of your information at any time, in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy and the applicable User Agreement by changing your profile or by closing your account, but please note that your withdrawal of consent will not be retroactive. 

Smarterer Communications. As described in the applicable User Agreement, we will communicate with you through email and notices posted on the Smarterer website or through other means available through the service, including mobile text messages. We may send you a series of emails that help inform new Users about the features of the Services, and we will also send you service messages relating to the functioning of the Services. If you are a Consumer User, we may also send you messages with promotional information directly or on behalf of our partners, unless you have opted out of receiving promotional information. Consumer Users can change e-mail and contact preferences at any time, by logging into your account and changing your settings related to your email notification choices. If you wish, you can also opt-out of receiving promotional emails by sending a request to Smarterer at info@smarterer.com.

Also, if we send communications to you via the carrier service with which you have a mobile communications subscription or otherwise have access, you understand you will pay any service fees associated with your receipt of messages on your mobile device (including text messaging charges). 

Customized Content. We use information provided to us (or to third parties with whom we offer combined services) to customize your experience on our website. For example, when you login to your account, we will display information about new tests or upgrades to prior tests we think may interest you. 

Sharing Information with Third Parties. If you are an Enterprise test-taker within an Enterprise, we share your Test and Scoring Information with administrators within your Enterprise. Likewise, if you are an Enterprise administrator, we share your Test Questions with other Users within your Enterprise. Smarterer does not otherwise sell, rent, or otherwise provide its Users’ personally identifiable information to third parties for marketing purposes. However, please note that all information that you elect to make available to the public may published to the public internet and cached by third-party search engines. We may provide aggregated anonymous data about the usage of the Services to third parties for purposes that we deem, in our sole discretion, to be appropriate. When you access your account via an SNS or other third party service, you are granting the third party site or service permission to access the information in your account (including your Profile Information and User-Generated Content). 

Working with Third Parties to Offer Services. We collaborate with third parties to offer services and functionality using Smarterer developer tools such as our application programming interfaces (""APIs""). These third parties are either partners (""Smarterer Partners"") with whom we have negotiated an agreement to provide services (""Combined Services""), or developers (""Platform Developers"") who have agreed to our API terms in our developer signup flow to build applications (""Platform Applications""). Both the negotiated agreements and our API terms and conditions contain restrictions on access, storage and use of your information. If you choose to use Combined Services or a Platform Application, you may be asked to confirm acceptance of the privacy policy and/or user agreement of the Smarterer Partner or Platform Developer, which have not necessarily been reviewed or approved by Smarterer. It is your choice whether or not to make use of Combined Services or Platform Applications and whether to proceed under any third party terms. Also, despite our agreements and technical steps taken to restrict access to and avoid possible misuse of information we may not screen or audit all Combined Services or Platform Applications. We also cannot guarantee that any Smarterer Partner or Platform Developer will abide by our agreement. You agree that your use of Combined Services or Platform Applications is on an ""as is"" basis and without any warranty. If you or other Users of Smarterer use or interact with any Combined Service or Platform Application, the Smarterer Partner or Platform Developer may access and share certain information about you with others, such as your profile information. To report any suspected misuse of information, contact Smarterer at info@smarterer.com. Smarterer is not responsible for your use of or inability to use any Combined Service or Platform Application, including the content, accuracy, or reliability of applications and the privacy practices or other policies of Smarterer Partners or Platform Developers. 

Compliance with Legal Process. It is possible that we may need to disclose personal information, profile information and/or information about your activities as a Smarterer User when required by subpoena or other legal process, or if Smarterer has a good faith belief that disclosure is necessary to (a) investigate, prevent or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities or to assist government enforcement agencies; (b) to enforce the applicable User Agreement, to investigate and defend ourselves against any third party claims or allegations, or to protect the security or integrity of our site; and/or (c) to exercise or protect the rights, property or personal safety of Smarterer, our Users, employees, or others. 

Disclosures to others. We may also disclose your personal information and other information you provide to another third party as part of a reorganization or a sale of the assets of Smarterer Corporation, a subsidiary or division. Any third party to which Smarterer transfers or sells Smarterer's assets will have the right to continue to use the personal and other information that you provide to us. 

###### Your information choices.

Accessing and Changing Your Information. You can review the personal information you provided to us or to the settings for your Smarterer account including your email and contact preferences, at any time by logging in to your account on the Smarterer website.

Smarterer may also retain and use your information if necessary to provide the Services to other Users. See “Accessing and Changing your Account Information” for details. Smarterer disclaims any liability in relation to the deletion or retention (subject to the terms herein) of information or any obligation not to delete the information. Smarterer does not control when search engines update their cache, which may contain certain public profile information that has since been removed from Smarterer's publicly viewable database. Users should carefully review Section 2 of the applicable User Agreement for additional information about licensing and ownership of personal information. 

Memorializing Accounts. If we learn that a User is deceased, we may memorialize the User's account. In these cases we may restrict profile access and close an account if we receive a formal request from the User's next of kin or other proper legal request to do so.

Personal Information Information We May Collect

Personal Information means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, a home or other physical address and an email address. In general, you can visit the Site and use its search engine and other features without telling us who you are or revealing any Personal Information about yourself. However, in order to access certain information, services or features contained on the Site, we may require you to provide Personal Information. For example, we will collect certain Personal Information if you choose to subscribe to our mailing list or send questions or comments to us via e-mail.

How We May Use Your Information

Some of our web pages utilize ""cookies"" and other tracking technologies. A cookie is a small text file that a website transfers to an individual's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies may be used, for example, to collect information about website activity. Most browsers allow you to control cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to remove them. You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your browser. However, please be aware that some features of the Site may not function properly or may be slower if you refuse cookies. You may occasionally get cookies from our advertisers or other third parties with links on the Site. We do not control these cookies. The use of advertising cookies sent by third-party servers is standard in the Internet industry. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.

Tracking technologies may record information such as Internet domain and host names; Internet protocol (IP) addresses; browser software and operating system types; click stream patterns; and dates and times that our Site is accessed. We do not link the information we record using tracking technologies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.

Search Engine

When you use our search engine, we may collect certain non-personally identifiable information through the use of cookies and other tracking technologies described above. For example, when you use our search engine, we may keep track of which search terms are popular. If we display advertising to you on the Site (including the search results pages displayed after any searches you may run), such advertising may be related to the search terms you entered. ISE may present search result links in a format that enables us to understand whether they have been followed and may monitor click-throughs on an individual and an aggregate basis. We use this information to understand and improve the quality of ISE's search technology. For instance, this data helps us determine how often users are satisfied with the first result of a query and how often they proceed to later results.

Certain search results may be ""sponsored"" results, which consist of websites who have paid for placement in the search results. These listings are provided by our business partner, Link Positions, which is a subsidiary of ISE. These premium results may contain tracking URLs provided by Link Positions to identify clicks from the search results page. Again, information gathered by these means will not personally identify you. Any information collected by Link Positions will be subject to Link Positions's privacy policy, and Link Positions and ISE may share information that either company gathers in connection with the use of ISE's search engine.

Links to Other Sites

Please be aware that when you are on the site, you could be directed to other sites that are beyond our control.

The privacy policies of these other sites may be significantly different from this Privacy Policy. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these other sites and cannot guarantee the security of any of your Personal Information collected there.

Security

Wherever your Personal Information may be held within ISE or on its behalf, we intend to take reasonable and appropriate steps to protect the Personal Information that you share with us from unauthorized access or disclosure. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your Personal Information and privacy, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you disclose or transmit to us online and cannot be responsible for the theft, destruction, or inadvertent disclosure of your Personal Information.

* Collecting Information

When you visit our consumer applications, we may collect information about you that you share with us by using our consumer applications. This identification information may include, but is not limited to, your name, physical address, email address, telephone and fax numbers, details of your real estate and lending needs and references, and other details of your life.

As you may be aware, it is a common practice that when you visit our consumer applications, we may collect data involving your usage through the use of “cookies” (i.e. small text files placed on your computer by consumer applications), web server logs, and other web tools. This technology allows us to customize your online experience as well as track your use of our system so that we can improve your experience. The tracking data we collect may include, but is not limited to, the date, time and location of your visit, the time you spend, the web pages you view, the other consumer applications you visit, your search queries, and basic information about your computer, such as your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, your domain name, your browser type, and the name of your internet service provider. You may deactivate cookies if you do not want your browsing to be tracked, but doing so may hinder your online experience.

When visiting our consumer-facing applications, you may be directed, through hyperlinks, to other consumer applications that are beyond our control. Furthermore, when you are visiting our consumer applications, other companies, such as third party advertisers and sponsors, may be gathering information about you. This Privacy Policy does not cover the collection of information by those other companies and consumer applications. Although we encourage third parties to provide their own privacy policies, we are not responsible for their activities, such as how they handle the information they collect online.

* Using Information Collected

We primarily use the identification information you voluntarily share with us to customize your online experience and to do what you have asked of us. We also use your identification information to tell you about our products and services, but you may instruct us not to send communications to you by following the procedure indicated below under “Contacting Us.” On occasion, we use your identification information to validate your identity. As for usage tracking data, we primarily use that information to operate and improve our consumer applications, and to further our marketing efforts. As a general rule, we do not share your information with unaffiliated third parties. We may, however, share your information with our own personnel and our service providers to the extent necessary to fulfill your requests. We may also share your information with our affiliates, but we will not share it with unaffiliated third parties for direct marketing purposes. We reserve the right to disclose your information under limited circumstances, such as to cooperate with law enforcement or judicial authorities as required by law or legal process, to protect our own legal rights, or to protect the public good.

Whenever you are online or on our applications, you run the risk that the information you give out will fall into the wrong hands. Although we implement and maintain commercially reasonable security procedures and practices to safeguard your privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you provide to us. We accept no responsibility or liability for the activities of third parties. By using our consumer applications and applications, you agree to our Terms of Use.

* Updating Information

If you would like to review the information about you that we have collected through our consumer applications, or to change that information, you can make that request by following the procedure indicated below under “Contacting Us.” We may require that you verify your identity before we process your request.

* Anti-Fraud Disclosure

Electronic communications such as email, text messages and social media messaging, are neither secure nor confidential. While ReeceNichols Realtors, Inc. (""Broker"") has adopted policies and procedures to aid in avoiding fraud, even the best security protections can still be bypassed by unauthorized parties. Broker will never send you any electronic communication with instructions to transfer funds or to provide nonpublic personal information, such as credit card or debit numbers or bank account and/or routing numbers.

YOU SHOULD NEVER TRANSMIT NONPUBLIC PERSONAL INFORMATION, SUCH AS CREDIT OR DEBIT CARD NUMBERS OR BANK ACCOUNT OR ROUTING NUMBERS, BY EMAIL OR OTHER UNSECURED ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATION. EMAILS ATTEMPTING TO INDUCE FRAUDULENT WIRE TRANSFERS ARE COMMON AND MAY APPEAR TO COME FROM A TRUSTED SOURCE.

If you receive any electronic communication directing you to transfer funds or provide nonpublic personal information, EVEN IF THAT ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATION APPEARS TO BE FROM Broker or its affiliates, do not respond to it and immediately contact Broker. Such requests, even if they may otherwise appear to be from Broker, are likely part of a scheme to defraud you by stealing funds from you or using your identity to commit a crime.

To notify Broker of suspected fraud related to your real estate transaction, send an email to Webmaster@ReeceAndNichols.com.

* Updating Our Privacy Policy

We may, from time to time, change our Privacy Policy. We will notify you of any changes by posting our updated Privacy Policy on our consumer applications and inserting a new “Effective Date.”

  1. Collecting Information

When you visit our consumer applications or purchase and/or sell real estate with ReeceNichols we may collect information about you that you share with us. We typically collect two kinds of information about you through our applications and real estate services: (a) information that you provide that personally identifies you; and (b) information that does not personally identify you, which we automatically collect when you visit our applications or that you provide to us.

    1. Personally Identifiable Information: This identification information may include, but is not limited to, your name, physical address, email address, telephone, mobile and fax numbers, details of your real estate, lending, title and insurance needs and references, and other details of your life (“Personal Information”).
    2. Non-Personally Identifiable Information: Our definition of non-personally identifiable information is any information that does not personally identify you (“Non-PII”). Non-PII can include certain personally identifiable information that has been de-identified; that is, information that has been rendered anonymous by a de-identification process. We obtain Non-PII about you from information that you affirmatively provide to us, either separately or together with your personally identifiable information. We also automatically collect certain Non-PII from you when you access any applications. This information can include, among other things, IP addresses, the type of browser you are using, the third-party website from which your visit originated, the operating system you are using, the domain name of your Internet service provider, the search terms you use on our applications, the specific web pages you visit, the duration and frequency of your visits, and location information.
    3. Cookies, Web Beacons and other Tracking Technologies: As you may be aware, it is a common practice that when you visit our consumer applications, we may collect data through the use of cookies, web beacons or other tracking technologies (i.e. small text files placed on your computer by consumer applications), web server logs, and other web tools. This technology allows us to customize your online experience as well as track your use of our system so that we can improve your experience. The tracking data we collect may include, but is not limited to, the date, time and location of your visit, the time you spend, the web pages you view, the other consumer applications you visit, your search queries, and basic information about your computer, such as your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, your domain name, your browser type, and the name of your internet service provider. By continuing to browse our site, you are agreeing to our use of cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but will also provide controls that allow you to block or delete them. Instructions for blocking or deleting cookies are generally available in your browser's privacy or help documentation. If you choose to delete cookies, some settings and preferences controlled by those cookies, including advertising preferences, will be deleted and may need to be recreated. You may deactivate cookies if you do not want your browsing to be tracked.

When visiting our consumer-facing applications, you may be directed, through hyperlinks, to other consumer applications that are beyond our control. This Privacy Policy does not cover the collection of information by those other companies and consumer applications. Although we encourage third parties to provide their own privacy policies, we are not responsible for their activities, such as how they handle the information they collect online.

  2. How We Use & Share Information Collected
    1. Personal Information: We primarily use the identification information you voluntarily share with us to:

      * Contact you for a variety of reasons, such as providing you promotional or marketing information for our products or those of our affiliated companies;
      * Communicate with you about your real estate transaction;
      * In certain instances, we may also share your personally identifiable information with our third-party vendors and marketing partners that, among other activities: perform functions on our behalf (or on behalf of our affiliated companies); administer our offerings; provide us marketing or promotional assistance; analyze our data; assist us with customer service; and offer other services and products that may be relevant to the purchase or sale of real estate. Our vendors agree to use this information, and we share information with them, only to carry out our requests;
      * On occasion, we use your identification information to validate your identity;
      * As for usage tracking data, we primarily use that information to operate and improve our consumer applications, and to further our marketing efforts.

You may opt-out from receiving future promotional or marketing information from us, our affiliated companies, and our third-party vendors, or direct that we not share your information with any affiliated companies or third-party vendors, as set forth below in Section 7. Except as provided in this Privacy Policy, our Terms of Use, or as set forth when you submit the information, your personally identifiable information will not be sold to any third parties or used in any manner outside the scope of this Privacy Policy without your prior approval. We further reserve the right to disclose your information under limited circumstances, such as to cooperate with law enforcement or judicial authorities as required by law or legal process, to protect our own legal rights, or to protect the public good.

    2. Non-PII: We use Non-PII in a variety of ways, including to: 
      * Help analyze site traffic, understand customer needs and trends;
      * Carry out targeted promotional activities;
      * Improve our services and offerings.

We may use your Non-PII by itself or aggregate it with information we have obtained from others. We may share your Non-PII with our affiliated companies and third parties to achieve these objectives and others, but remember that aggregate information is anonymous information that does not personally identify you.

Whenever you are online or on our applications, you run the risk that the information you provide will fall into the wrong hands. Although we implement and maintain commercially reasonable security procedures and practices to safeguard your privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you provide to us. We accept no responsibility or liability for the activities of third parties. By using our consumer applications and applications, you agree to our Terms of Use.

  * Privacy Statement 



We know that you care how information about you is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly. This Privacy Statement outlines the information Reliant will collect and how we will use that information. 

#### What Information We Collect

Reliant's primary goal in collecting information is to allow us to offer products and services which are relevant to consumers like you. Personal information also allows us to provide services and features that most likely meet your needs, and to customize our service to make your experience smooth and efficient. Any personal information that we collect will only be used for internal marketing purposes of Reliant, except as otherwise required by law or as disclosed to you in this Privacy Statement. The information we collect:

  * Information You Give Us   
Reliant will not collect any personal information from you unless you provide it to us voluntarily. We may ask you to provide information including your name, address, government-issued identification card number, social security number, telephone number, and email address. In addition, we may ask you to provide information relating to energy use, such as the characteristics of your home, your age, gender and family size, or we may ask you to state your opinion about potential products and services. If you opt not to provide us with personal information, we may be unable to deliver certain promotions or product information to you that you have requested.
  * Non-personal, Aggregate and Statistical Data   
Reliant may collect certain non-personal or aggregate data. For example, we may use web log information (such as your web browser, operating system, pages visited, etc.) and use cookies when you visit many of our web pages. For instance, when you visit one of our websites, our web server will automatically recognize some non-personal information, including but not limited to the date and time you visited our site, the pages you visited, the referrer (the website you came from), the type of browser you are using (e.g. Internet Explorer or Safari), the type of operating system you are using (e.g. Windows or Mac), and the domain name and address of your Internet service provider (e.g. AT&T or Comcast).
  * Email Addresses   
At the time Reliant requests an email address from you, you will be given the opportunity to indicate whether or not you wish to receive future email solicitations from us. We may, however, send you emails for other reasons such as responding to your requests for service or information or matters relative to your account.
  * Information from Other Sources   
For reasons such as providing better product recommendations or special offers that we think will interest you and to identify persons not already a Reliant customer, we receive information from other sources and add it to our information. The type of information we receive may include (but is not limited to) your name, address, telephone number, and in some cases, type and characteristics of your home, your age, and statistical estimates of your family size, income and home value. We also sometimes receive updated delivery and address information so that we can correct our records and deliver your next communication more easily.

#### How We Collect Information

  * Information You Give Us   
Reliant does not require potential customers or visitors to our websites to provide personal information, except as necessary to be enrolled as a customer. You may choose to enter contests, vote in polls or otherwise express an opinion, subscribe to one of our services such as newsletters, or participate in one of our online forums or communities. These programs may require you to submit some information in order to participate. These programs and the types of information required are described in more detail below.
  * Registration/Subscriptions   
To fully use our websites, visitors may need to register using our online registration forms, where visitors may be required to provide us with some personal information. Visitors may also be asked to select a user ID and password. Further, to register for certain services or become a member of certain communities, we may ask visitors to submit their name, email address, home address, and zip code. You can further make choices about receiving targeted newsletters and alerts from Reliant. You can always decide not to receive or stop receiving any targeted solicitations from Reliant that you do not want.
  * Contests/Sweepstakes   
Reliant may run contests, sweepstakes and other promotions. We may ask you to provide personal information that is needed in order to administer the contest, sweepstakes or promotion and to notify winners.
  * Referrals   
Occasionally, you will have the opportunity to forward promotional opportunities or other information on the website to friends/relatives or to send messages from our web sites to friends/relatives. This personal referral information you provide to facilitate this communication is used on a one-time basis and is not further retained by Reliant, except in circumstances where we obtain consent from the people you have referred to receive communications from us.
  * Questionnaires, Surveys and Profile Data   
Reliant may occasionally ask you to complete surveys and opinion polls about your interests, needs, and attitudes. Surveys help us provide better services and products that meet customer needs. Participation is voluntary and these surveys are optional.
  * Customer Services and Contact Information   
If you provide our customer service representatives with feedback on your experiences with our products/services or otherwise submit questions to our customer service representatives or webmasters, you will be asked to supply personal information for our record keeping and follow-up.
  * Non-personal, Aggregate and Statistical Data   
Reliant may collect certain aggregate data called web log information and use cookies when you visit many of our web pages. For instance, when you visit one of our websites, our web server will automatically recognize some non-personal information, including but not limited to the date and time you visited our site, the pages you visited, the referrer (the website you came from), the type of browser you are using (e.g. Internet Explorer or Safari), the type of operating system you are using (e.g. Windows or Mac), and the domain name and address of your Internet service provider (e.g. AT&T or Comcast).
  * Information from Other Sources   
For reasons such as providing better product recommendations or special offers that we think will interest you and to identify persons not already a Reliant customer, we receive information from other sources and add it to our information. The sources that provide this information have obtained it from public sources or from voluntary informational surveys.

#### How We Use Your Information

  * Personal Information   
We may use your personal information to contact you. For example, we may send you marketing or promotional materials including emails or other information; we may respond to your comments or requests for information; or we may contact you if needed in the course of fulfilling your service request. We may also use your personal information to confirm and verify your customer enrollment status, and for credit approval. Reliant does not collect personal information automatically, but we may combine non-personal information collected automatically (e.g., through cookies and web beacons) with your previously submitted personal information. We may also enhance or merge personal information with data obtained from third parties for the same purposes. We use this personal and statistical information about you to improve our marketing and promotional efforts; to statistically analyze site usage; to improve our content and product offerings; and to customize our sites' content, layout and services. We may also use your information to deliver information to you that, in some cases, is targeted to your interests, such as targeted banners, new services and promotions. We believe these uses allow us to improve our site and better tailor it to meet our visitors' needs. Reliant occasionally sends emails describing new products, promotions or events. These email services are optional and you may opt-out of these services completely, at any time.
  * Non-personal, Aggregate and Statistical Data   
Reliant uses web log information (such as your web browser, operating system, pages visited, etc.) to help us design our website, to identify popular features, and for other managerial purposes. However, web logs may be used if necessary to help identify any person attempting to break into or damage our website. We may share web log information with law enforcement agencies if we believe that we have evidence of a violation of computer security or related laws.

#### How We May Share Your Information

  * For Promotional Purposes   
Except in the event of a business transfer, we will not share, trade or sell personal information about you for promotional use by any business, other than Reliant and its affiliates. However, we may sometimes send offers to Reliant customers on behalf of other businesses. When we do this, we do not give that business the name, address, telephone number or email address of our customers. When companies acquire other businesses, sell all, or portions of their business, customer information generally is one of the transferred assets. If Reliant or substantially all of its assets are transferred through merger, acquisition, bankruptcy or any other change of corporate control then, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets. Aggregated and statistical data from our website visitors may be shared with our partners. For example, we may let a partner know that approximately ""20,000 people visited a web page regarding a specific joint promotion."" All employees, contractors and other companies engaged by Reliant for work that involves access to personal information are contractually required to keep the information confidential and not to use it in any way other than what is necessary to perform their work for Reliant.
  * For Protection of Reliant and Others   
We may release personal data, including account information, when we believe release is appropriate to comply with laws, regulations or judicial orders; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Reliant, our customers, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. Reliant also reserves the right to share the information to respond to duly authorized information requests of governmental authorities or where required by law or regulation.

The collection of this non-personal information is done either through the ""cookie"" technology or with ""web beacons"" (also called ""single-pixel gif"" or ""web pings""). Neither our cookies nor web beacons nor web log information collects any personal information. They do not contain personal information such as your name or email address.

  * Cookies   
When you view one of our websites or interactive advertisements, we may store some information on your computer. This information will be in the form of a small text file, also called a ""cookie"".

They also allow us to tailor a website or advertisement to better match your interests and preferences. Most browsers can be configured not to accept cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.
  * Web Beacons   
Web beacons are site instrumentation that help us to determine, for instance, whether a page has been viewed or not and, if so, how many times. When you ask us to send you information on a promotion or a newsletter, we may use web beacons to establish how many of the emails are actually opened. In general, any electronic image viewed as part of a web page or email, including an ad banner, can act as a web beacon. Third party advertising networks that serve ads onto any Reliant website may use cookies and/or web beacons in their advertisements. Reliant retains no control over such third party cookies and/or web beacons and does not have access to the information related to third party cookies and/or web beacons.

#### Data Security

Reliant is committed to keeping the data you provide us secure and will take reasonable precautions to protect your personal information from loss, misuse or alteration, including limiting access to such information within Reliant to authorized individuals and destroying personal information that we decide not to retain in a manner designed to make it unreadable or undecipherable.

#### Your Preferences

Reliant allows you to choose to receive or stop receiving solicitations from us. We accomplish this by maintaining a “Solicitation Preference File” in which we record your preferences to receive or not receive solicitations from us. We use two suppression files provided by the Direct Marketing Association, the Mail Preference Service and Telephone Preference Service files; and we use the National Do Not Call Registry.

Privacy Statement

Back to Top
","We know that you care how information about you is collected, used and shared, and we appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly. This Privacy Statement applies to the use of all products, services, websites, and mobile applications offered by Reliant and offered by Reliant and our affiliates, unless they have a different Privacy Policy. This Privacy Statement outlines the information Reliant will collect and how we will use that information. 

#### What Information We Collect

Reliant's primary goal in collecting information is to allow us to offer products and services which are relevant to consumers like you. Personal information also allows us to provide services and features that most likely meet your needs, and to customize our service to make your experience smooth and efficient. Any personal information that we collect will only be used for internal marketing purposes of Reliant, except as otherwise required by law or as disclosed to you in this Privacy Statement. The information we collect:

  * Information You Give Us   
Reliant will not collect any personal information from you unless you provide it to us voluntarily. We may ask you to provide information including your name, address, government-issued identification card number, social security number, telephone number, and email address. In addition, we may ask you to provide information relating to energy use, such as the characteristics of your home, your age, gender and family size, or we may ask you to state your opinion about potential products and services. If you opt not to provide us with personal information, we may be unable to deliver certain promotions or product information to you that you have requested.
  * Non-personal, Aggregate and Statistical Data   
Reliant may collect certain non-personal or aggregate data. For example, we may use web log information (such as your web browser, operating system, pages visited, etc.) and use cookies when you visit many of our web pages. For instance, when you visit one of our websites, our web server will automatically recognize some non-personal information, including but not limited to the date and time you visited our site, the pages you visited, the referrer (the website you came from), the type of browser you are using (e.g. Internet Explorer or Safari), the type of operating system you are using (e.g. Windows or Mac), and the domain name and address of your Internet service provider (e.g. AT&T or Comcast).
  * Email Addresses   
At the time Reliant requests an email address from you, you will be given the opportunity to indicate whether or not you wish to receive future email solicitations from us. We may, however, send you emails for other reasons such as responding to your requests for service or information or matters relative to your account.
  * Information from Other Sources   
For reasons such as improving our products and services, making product recommendations or special offers that we think will interest you and to identify persons not already a Reliant customer, we receive information from other sources and add it to our information. The type of information we receive may include (but is not limited to) your name, address, telephone number, and in some cases, type and characteristics of your home, your age, and statistical estimates of your family size, income and home value. We also sometimes receive updated delivery and address information so that we can correct our records and deliver your next communication more easily.

You may choose to enter contests, vote in polls or otherwise express an opinion, subscribe to one of our services such as newsletters, or participate in one of our online forums or communities. These programs may require you to submit some information in order to participate. These programs and the types of information required are described in more detail below.

To fully use our websites, visitors may need to register using our online registration forms, where visitors may be required to provide us with some personal information.

  * Referrals   
Occasionally, you will have the opportunity to forward promotional opportunities or other information on the website to friends/relatives or to send messages from our web sites to friends/relatives. This personal referral information you provide to facilitate this communication is used on a one-time basis and is not further retained by Reliant, except in circumstances where we obtain consent from the people you have referred to receive communications from us.
  * Questionnaires, Surveys and Profile Data   
Reliant may occasionally ask you to complete surveys and opinion polls about your interests, needs, and attitudes. Surveys help us provide better services and products that meet customer needs. Participation is voluntary and these surveys are optional.

#### How We Use Your Information

  * Personal Information   
We may use your personal information to contact you. For example, we may send you marketing or promotional materials including emails or other information; we may respond to your comments or requests for information; or we may contact you if needed in the course of fulfilling your service request. We may also use your personal information to confirm and verify your customer enrollment status, and for credit approval. Reliant does not collect personal information automatically, but we may combine non-personal information collected automatically (e.g., through cookies and web beacons) with your previously submitted personal information. We may also enhance or merge personal information with data obtained from third parties for the same purposes. We use this personal and statistical information about you to improve our marketing and promotional efforts; to statistically analyze site usage; to improve our content and product offerings; and to customize our sites' content, layout and services. We may also use your information to deliver information to you that, in some cases, is targeted to your interests, such as targeted banners, new services and promotions. We believe these uses allow us to improve our site and better tailor it to meet our visitors' needs. Reliant occasionally sends emails describing new products, promotions or events. These email services are optional and you may opt-out of these services completely, at any time.
  * Non-personal, Aggregate and Statistical Data   
Reliant uses web log information (such as your web browser, operating system, pages visited, etc.) to help us design our website, to identify popular features, and for other managerial purposes. However, web logs may be used if necessary to help identify any person attempting to break into or damage our website. We may share web log information with law enforcement agencies if we believe that we have evidence of a violation of computer security or related laws.

#### How We May Share Your Information

  * For Promotional Purposes   
Except in the event of a business transfer, we will not share, trade or sell personal information about you for promotional use by any business, other than Reliant and its affiliates. Subject, to any applicable legal restrictions, we may share personal information about you with our affiliates and any vendor we use to support our business or provide service to you, including any rewards partner. If you provide your consent for non-affiliates to market their products and services to you, we may share personal information about you for that purpose. We may sometimes send offers to Reliant customers on behalf of other businesses. When we do this, we do not give that business the name, address, telephone number or email address of our customers. We may share information with third parties and business partners that is in aggregated or anonymous form so that it does not divulge personal information, and may work with those entities to do research, including for marketing purposes, and to provide and improve products and services. When companies acquire other businesses, sell all, or portions of their business, customer information generally is one of the transferred assets. If Reliant or substantially all of its assets are transferred through merger, acquisition, bankruptcy or any other change of corporate control then, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets. Aggregated and statistical data from our website visitors may be shared with our partners. For example, we may let a partner know that approximately ""20,000 people visited a web page regarding a specific joint promotion."" All employees, contractors and other companies engaged by Reliant for work that involves access to personal information are contractually required to keep the information confidential and not to use it in any way other than what is necessary to perform their work for Reliant.
  * For Protection of Reliant and Others   
We may release personal data, including account information, when we believe release is appropriate to comply with laws, regulations or judicial orders; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Reliant, our customers, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. Reliant also reserves the right to share the information to respond to duly authorized information requests of governmental authorities or where required by law or regulation.

#### Disposal of Your Personal Information

Reliant maintains your personal information in our records when you are a customer. We also maintain personal information for a period of time after you are no longer a customer if necessary for the purposes for which it was collected. These purposes may include business, legal or tax purposes. If these purposes no longer apply, we will destroy, or de-identify, or anonymize the information in accordance with our internal policies and applicable law.

#### Cookies and Web Beacons

When you view one of our websites, we may collect some non-personal information about you. The collection of this non-personal information is done either through the ""cookie"" technology or with ""web beacons"" (also called ""single-pixel gif"" or ""web pings""). Neither our cookies nor web beacons nor web log information collects any personal information. They do not contain personal information such as your name or email address.

  * Cookies   
When you view one of our websites or interactive advertisements, we may store some information on your computer. This information will be in the form of a small text file, also called a ""cookie"".

They also allow us to tailor a website or advertisement to better match your interests and preferences. Most browsers can be configured not to accept cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.
  * Web Beacons   
Web beacons are site instrumentation that help us to determine, for instance, whether a page has been viewed or not and, if so, how many times. When you ask us to send you information on a promotion or a newsletter, we may use web beacons to establish how many of the emails are actually opened. In general, any electronic image viewed as part of a web page or email, including an ad banner, can act as a web beacon. Third party advertising networks that serve ads onto any Reliant website may use cookies and/or web beacons in their advertisements. Reliant retains no control over such third party cookies and/or web beacons and does not have access to the information related to third party cookies and/or web beacons.

Founded in 1946, REEDS Jewelers is a leading full-service multi-channel jewelry retailer, with stores in 18 states, a national direct mail catalog , and an ecommerce web site, www.REEDS.com, serving customers across all 50 states and those stationed abroad at APO/FPO addresses. To view our current roster of REEDS stores, please view our Store Locations . 

PLEASE NOTE: REEDS Jewelers, Inc., is not associated with any other jewelry chain or store using the name REEDS or REEDS Jewelers.

### What Information Does REEDS Collect?

REEDS collects information you provide to us to serve your needs. For example, if you place an order, or simply register on our site, you will provide to us your name, address, email address, phone number and credit card information. Of course, if you are placing an order, you will need to know the product(s) you wish to purchase. 

REEDS also collects information you voluntarily submit when participating in one of our various services, promotions, programs or surveys. From your transactions and other interactions with us, we obtain information concerning the specific products or services you purchase or use. 

REEDS also receives information about you from other companies, including, but not limited to information on your creditworthiness for private label credit card offers and products you may be interested in purchasing. 

REEDS is a highly ethical company and requires the highest standard of conduct from our employees and business partners. As members of the Jewelers of America and other distinguished industry organizations, we adhere to the Direct Marketing Association's Guidelines for Ethical Business Practice, Shopping and Consumer Rights and the DMA's Privacy Promise. 

### How Does REEDS Use The Information Collected?

REEDS may use the information collected as follows: 

  * to complete your purchase transactions and provide the services you request; 
  * to send you catalogs and other offerings through the mail; 
  * to contact you about the status of your orders; 
  * to identify your product and service preferences, so that you can be informed of new or additional products, services, and promotions that might be of interest to you; 
  * to notify you of product recalls or provide other information concerning products you have purchased; and 
  * to improve our merchandise selections, customer service, and overall customer shopping experience. 



See third-party advertising below. 

### What Information Does REEDS Share with Others?

Affiliated Partners: REEDS may share the collected information with affiliated partner companies and licensees in order to deliver contractually designated products and services. For example, in some cases we may use service provider partners to help us perform some of these tasks, including, but not limited to, processing or fulfilling your orders or performing customer service, business analyses or quality control (e.g., we use UPS to deliver most of our packages to our customers), and consequently we may share your contact information with these service providers. In such cases, we will require these service providers to enter into agreements with us regarding the confidential handling of your information. We may also provide your contact information to your credit card issuer or to credit card processors for their purposes in processing your order. When you make a purchase through the REEDS.com web site, or register with the REEDS.com web site, you will provide us with an email address where we, or these service providers, may contact you for the purposes described in this paragraph. 

Legal Disclosures: In the highly unlikely event REEDS is required to disclose customer information pursuant to lawful requests, such as subpoenas or court orders, or in compliance with applicable laws, REEDS will make such disclosure. In the event the ownership of all or a part of a business within REEDS Jewelers were to change, customer information pertinent to that business's operations would likely be transferred to, or licensed for use by, the new owner. 

Third Party Offers: If REEDS chooses to offer you selected third party products and services that we think would be of benefit to you and you accept the offer, REEDS would supply this third party firm with just the personal information necessary for this partner to deliver the offer, product or service to you. 

REEDS Credit Card Account: We may share your information with the bank that issues REEDS credit card accounts, World Financial Network National Bank. (You can read their privacy policy at https://onlineaccess.mycreditcard.cc/REEDS?Action=Privacy.jsp.) 

### Does REEDS use Third-Party Advertising?

REEDS may share web site usage information about visitors to our web site, who have received a targeted promotional campaign, with a reputable third-party advertising or marketing company for the purpose of targeting future campaigns and upgrading visitor information used in reporting statistics. For this purpose, we and our third-party advertising or marketing company may note some of the pages you visit on our web site through the use of pixel tags (also called clear gifs). This information is not shared outside of this arrangement.

#### How to Be Removed from a Paper Catalog Mailing List

You can contact us by mail, phone or email and simply request that you be removed from the catalog mailing list. 

We will make every effort to implement any choice you make as soon as possible, but you should allow approximately three months for mailing change requests to be fully implemented due to lead times with external vendors on printed materials.

Note that unsubscribing from promotional emails will not affect your receipt of order status emails which will still be provided to you after purchasing online at REEDS.com. 

### Are REEDS Credit Cards Available?

Yes. You can apply for a REEDS credit card account issued by World Financial Network National Bank to receive special offers and participate in exclusive brand benefits, including the REEDS Rewards program, in which you accumulate points to spend at REEDS for every dollar threshold you meet.

To request occasional promotional email offers, notifying you of special deals, web-only offers, product previews, and in-store events for stores near you, you may sign up for Email Offers on this web site, or call, fax or write us at the address listed above. To remove your name from any email offer list, click the unsubscribe link in any of our marketing emails you receive, login to My Account under the My Info section of REEDS.com, or contact our Customer Service Center. Registered web site users who have purchased from REEDS.com will receive standard order status communications, such as order confirmation, shipping dates, etc. via email at the registered email account the user has designated. Your choice to opt-in or opt-out of promotional emails will not affect the order status and registration service. 

### How Does REEDS Safeguard the Information Collected?
